A Java-based implementation of FL that covers:
- parsing
- pretty-printing
- evaluation

The implementation has been tested with Java 5 and 6.
The parser relies on ANTLR.
The implementation has been tested with antlrworks-1.1.7.jar.
Pretty printing and evaluation are implemented as visitors.
Pretty printing uses inefficient string concatenation.

Run "make" to test the implementation.
