Python (with pyparsing) implementation of FL with support for:

    - parsing
    - pretty printing
    - evaluation
    - optimization

All features (except parsing) are implemented as mixins for the base classes.
There are a few unittests in tests.py and a little demo of what PyFL can do
in main.py.

To start the examples just run them from your favorite shell, i.e.:

    > python main.py

Note: PyFL requires Python 2.5!
