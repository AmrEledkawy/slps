A Java-based implementation of FL that covers:
- parsing
- pretty-printing
- evaluation
- optimization

The implementation has been tested with Java 6.
The parser relies on ANTLR.
The implementation has been tested with antlrworks-1.1.7.jar.
Evaluation, pretty printing, and evaluation rely on tom (and gom).
The implementation has been tested with tom 2.6.
That jars for ANTLR and tom need to be in the CLASSPATH.
The command-line tools tom and gom need to be in the PATH.

Run "make" to test the implementation.
