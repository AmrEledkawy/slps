Two deliverables are derived from IBM's standard for VS Cobol II: a
re-engineered Cobol reference and a Cobol prototype parser. This will
involve a number of steps that are reported on the standard output.
See the Makefile in grammars/vscobolii for an detailed overview of the
steps. The final step is to parse a simple Cobol program. For legal
reasons, we cannot distribute actual Cobol projects with this
distribution.

The test deals with the following files:

- grammars/vscobolii/ibm.html
  This is IBM's standard which serves as input for grammar recovery.

- grammars/vscobolii/ibm-transformed.html
  This is the improved document adapted by commented grammar
  transformations for grammar recovery.

- grammars/vscobolii/ibm-transformed.pl
  This is a DCG (Prolog) serving as prototype parser. It has derived
  by applying some further grammar transformations for deployment to
  the recovered grammar.

- grammars/vscobolii/recovery/*.fst
  These are transformation scripts for grammar recovery.

- grammars/vscobolii/deployment/*.fst
  These are transformation scripts for grammar deployment.

GRK is based on library functionality for Prological language
processing and tools that automate certain aspects of grammar
engineering; see the subdirectories lib and tools.
