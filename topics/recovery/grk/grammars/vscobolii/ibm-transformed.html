<H1>Re-engineered VS COBOL II Application Programming Language
Reference</H1>
</A>

<B>Important disclaimer</B>: This is NOT "<I>IBM's VS COBOL II
Application Programming Language Reference</I>" but the present
document has been <I>derived</I> from IBM's document in the sense of
"document re-engineering". This derivation has not been approved by
IBM in any way. The derivation has been performed by <A
HREF=http://www.cwi.nl/~ralf>Ralf L&auml;mmel</A> in a research effort
on grammar engineering at the <A HREF=http://www.cwi.nl>CWI</A> and
the <A HREF=http://www.cs.vu.nl>Free University</A> in Amsterdam.
While this document is thought to be useful as a completed, corrected,
and linked version of IBM's document, the document comes with
ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. To the extent possible, the document is
COPYRIGHT Ralf L&auml;mmel, CWI, Free University Amsterdam, say to the
extent not covered by IBM's copyright.

<P>

The overall <I>intention</I> of this improved, say re-engineered
version of IBM's document is to provide a useful Cobol grammar as part
of the full, though modified IBM reference document. The original IBM
document was retrieved from the IBM BookManager, and all necessary
adaptations were traced in scripts; see the <A
HREF=http://ww.cs.vu.nl/grammars/grk>GRK</A> distribution for
details. These adaptations are concerned with completing the diagrams
(i.e., adding syntax that was not in IBM's document previously),
correcting the diagrams (i.e., rephrasing syntax which is in conflict
with the intended one), and refactoring diagrams (to obtain a more
concise definition of the Cobol syntax).  All adaptations are
described by comments before the corresponding diagrams. (All these
comment lines start with @@.)

and other Cobol documents.

<LI> <A HREF=ibm-prepared.html>The reverse-engineered IBM document</A>
that was derived from this reverse-engineered document; this is
probably the Cobol document you are looking for because one might say
that it comprehends the most authoritive Cobol definition.

<LI> A local copy of <A HREF=ibm.html>the underlying IBM document</A>
downloaded in 1999; you probably do not want to click on this because
the above reverse-engineered version is more useful as it is linked
and notational anomalies were eliminated.

<p>
 | VS COBOL II supports the following industry standards in the MVS, VM, and 
 | VSE environments, as understood and interpreted by IBM as of September 
 | 1989: 
<p>
 | 1.  ISO 1989:1985, Programming Languages--COBOL. 
<p>
 |     ISO 1989:1985 is identical to X3.23-1985, American National Standard 
 |     for Information Systems--Programming Language--COBOL. 
<p>
 |     For supported modules, see 2 below. 
<p>
 | 2.  X3.23-1985, American National Standard for Information 
 |     Systems--Programming Language--COBOL. 
<p>
 |     Under MVS and VM, VS COBOL II supports all required modules at the 
 |     highest level defined by the standard. 
<p>
 |     Under VSE, VS COBOL II supports all required modules at the 
 |     intermediate level.  It also supports all required modules at the high 
 |     level with the exception of the following language features: 
<p>
 |     o   EXTEND phrase of the OPEN statement (However, OPEN EXTEND for VSAM 
 |         sequential files <B>is</B> supported.) 
 |     o   REVERSED phrase of the OPEN statement 
 |     o   OF/IN phrase of the COPY statement. 
<p>
 |     In the following list, the shorthand notation describing module levels 
 |     is shown in parentheses.  For example, to summarize module information 
 |     for sequential input/output, the shorthand notation is (2 SEQ 1,2). 
 |     The first digit indicates the level of language elements within the 
 |     module supported by VS COBOL II. Next is the three-character 
 |     abbreviation of the module name as used in the standard.  Finally, the 
 |     two digits separated by a comma indicate the minimum and maximum 
 |     levels of the module.  For example, (2 SEQ 1,2) means that VS COBOL II 
 |     supports the sequential I-O module at level 2, while the range of 
 |     levels in the module is from 1 (minimum) to 2 (maximum). 
<p>
       o   Nucleus (2 NUC 1,2) 
<p>
           Provides internal processing of data within the four basic 
           divisions of a program and the capability for defining and 
           accessing tables. 
<p>
       o   Sequential I-O (2 SEQ 1,2) 
<p>
           Provides access to records of a file in established sequence.  The 
           sequence is established as a result of writing the records to the 
           file. 
<p>
       o   Relative I-O (2 REL 0,2) 
<p>
           Provides access to records in either a random or sequential 
           manner.  Each record is uniquely identified by an integer 
           specifying the record's logical position in a file. 
<p>
       o   Indexed I-O (2 INX 0,2) 
<p>
           Provides access to records in either a random or sequential 
           manner.  Each record in an indexed file is uniquely identified by 
           the value of a key within that record. 
<p>
       o   Sort-Merge (1 SRT 0,1) 
<p>
           Orders one or more files of records, or combines two or more 
           identically ordered files of records, according to a set of 
           user-specified keys. 
<p>
       o   Inter-Program Communication (2 IPC 1,2) 
<p>
           Allows a COBOL program to communicate with other programs through 
           transfers of control and access to common data items. 
<p>
       o   Source Text Manipulation (2 STM 0,2) 
<p>
           Allows the insertion of source program text as part of the 
           compilation of the source program.  COBOL libraries contain texts 
           which are available to the compiler at compile time and which can 
           be treated by the compiler as part of the source program. 
<p>
 |     In addition, the following levels of optional modules are supported: 
<p>
       o   Debug (1 DEB 0,2) 
<p>
           Monitors object program execution through declarative procedures, 
           special debugging lines, and a special register, DEBUG-ITEM, which 
           gives specific information about execution status. 
<p>
       o   Segmentation (2 SEG 0,2) 
<p>
           Refreshes independent segments when required. 
<p>
 |     The following optional modules of the standard are not supported: 
<p>
 |     o   Report Writer 
 |     o   Communications 
 |     o   Debug (2 DEB 0,2) 
 |     o   Intrinsic Functions 
<p>
<p>
 | 3.  FIPS Publication 21-3, Federal Information Processing Standard 21-3, 
 |     COBOL.  VS COBOL II supports the FIPS intermediate subset, and the 
 |     FIPS high subset except for the Intrinsic Functions module. 
<p>

<p>
 | When running under VSE/ESA V1R3 on an extended architecture processor, VS 
 | COBOL II Release 4 can use 31-bit addressing, allowing you to take 
 | advantage of storage above the 16-megabyte line.  (VS COBOL II R3.0 (or 
 | later) already uses the 31-bit addressing feature of the MVS and VM 
 | operating systems.)

</banner>
<pre width="80">
   The most basic and indivisible unit of the COBOL language is the 
   <B>character</B>.  The VS COBOL II character set includes the letters of the 
   alphabet, digits, and special characters.  The complete set of characters 
   that form the VS COBOL II character set is shown in Table 2. 
<p>
   The VS COBOL II language is restricted to the above character set, but the 
   content of nonnumeric literals, comment lines, comment entries, and data 
   can include any of the characters from the character set of the computer. 
<p>
 x Characters from the Double-Byte Character Set (DBCS) are valid characters 
 x in certain COBOL character-strings.  Double-byte characters, as the name 
 x implies, occupy two adjacent bytes to represent 1 character.  DBCS values 
 x range from X'41' to X'FE' for both bytes, plus X'4040' for a blank.  In 
 x addition, DBCS data items and literals can include characters that range 
 x in hexadecimal value from X'00' to X'FF' for both bytes. 
<p>
   Individual characters are joined to form <B>character-strings</B>, <B>separators</B>, 
 | and <B>text</B> <B>words</B>. 
<p>
   A <B>character-string</B> is a character or a sequence of contiguous characters 
   that forms a COBOL word, a literal, a PICTURE character-string, or a 
   comment.  A character-string is delimited by separators. 
<p>
   A <B>separator</B> is a string of one or more contiguous punctuation characters. 
   Separators are described in detail under <A HREF=#1.1.2>&quot;Separators&quot; in topic 1.1.2</A>.

<pre width="80">
<p>
 | A COBOL word is a character-string of not more than 30 characters which 
 | forms a user-defined word, a system-name, or a reserved word.  Except for 
 | arithmetic operators and relation characters, each character of a COBOL 
 | word is selected from the set of letters, digits, and the hyphen; the 
 | hyphen cannot appear as the first or last character in such words.  Each 
 | lowercase letter is considered to be equivalent to its corresponding 
 | uppercase letter. 
<p>
 | Within a source program the following rules apply for all COBOL words: 
<p>
 | o   A reserved word cannot be used as a user-defined word or as a 
 |     system-name. 
<p>
 | o   The same COBOL word, however, can be used as both a user-defined word 
 |     and as a system-name.  The classification of a specific occurrence of 
 |     a COBOL word is determined by the context of the clause or phrase in 
 |     which it occurs.

   The function of each user-defined word is described in the clause or 
   statement in which it appears. 
<p>
 | User-defined words form sets equivalent to the types in the preceding

   program, but excluding any contained program, each user-defined word 
   (except level-numbers and priority-numbers) can belong to only <B>one</B> of 
   these sets.  Each user-defined word within a set must be unique, except as 
   specified in <A HREF=#1.5>&quot;Methods of Data Reference&quot; in topic 1.5</A>. 
<p>
   The following types of user-defined words can be referenced by statements 
   and entries in that program in which the user-defined word is declared: 
<p>
 | o   paragraph-name 
 | o   section-name. 
<p>
   The following types of user-defined words can be referenced by any COBOL 
   program, provided that the compiling system supports the associated 
   library or other system, and the entities referenced are known to that 
   system: 
<p>
 | o   library-name 
 | o   text-name. 
<p>
<p>
   The following types of names, when they are declared within a 
   Configuration Section, can be referenced by statements and entries either 
   in that program that contains a Configuration Section, or in any program 
   contained within that program: 
<p>
 | o   alphabet-name 
 | o   class-name 
 | o   condition-name 
 | o   mnemonic-name 
 | o   symbolic-character. 
<p>
 | An <B>external-name</B> is a character string that is one of the following:

 x o   DBCS user-defined words begin with a shift-out character, have 1 to 14 
 x     DBCS characters, and end with a shift-in character.  (For more 
 x     information on shift-out and shift-in characters, see topic <A HREF=#1.1.1.9>1.1.1.9</A>.) 
<p>
 x o   DBCS user-defined words can contain characters whose values range from 
 x     X'41' to X'FE' for both bytes. 
<p>
 x o   A DBCS user-defined word must contain at least one double-byte 
 x     non-EBCDIC character.  (Double-byte EBCDIC characters are represented 
 x     by X'42' in the first byte.) 
<p>
 x o   DBCS user-defined words can contain both double-byte EBCDIC and 
 x     double-byte non-EBCDIC characters.  The only double-byte EBCDIC 
 x     characters allowed are:  &quot;-&quot;, A - Z, a - z, and 0 - 9.  The hyphen 
 x     cannot appear as the first or last character.  (The rules that apply 
 x     to EBCDIC user-defined words also apply to DBCS user-defined words.) 
<p>
 x o   DBCS user-defined words cannot be continued across lines. 
<p>
 | o   In a DBCS user-defined word, lowercase double-byte letters are 
 |     equivalent to the corresponding uppercase double-byte letters.

   A <B>system-name</B> is a character string that is defined by IBM to have a 
   specific meaning to the system.  There are three types of system-names: 
<p>
 | o   computer-name 
 | o   language-name 
 | o   implementor-name. 
<p>
   There are two types of implementor-names: 
<p>
 | o   environment-name 
 | o   assignment-name. 
<p>
   The meaning of each system-name is described with the format in which it 
   appears. 
<p>
 x The only system-name that can be specified in DBCS is &quot;computer-name.&quot;

</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   <B>Figurative</B> <B>constants</B> are reserved words that name and refer to specific 
   constant values.  The reserved words for figurative constants and their 
   meanings are: 
<p>
   <kbd>ZERO/ZEROS/ZEROES</kbd> 
       Represents the numeric value zero (0), or one or more occurrences of 
       the nonnumeric character zero (0), depending on context. 
<p>
   <kbd>SPACE/SPACES</kbd> 
       Represents one or more blanks or spaces; treated as a nonnumeric 
       literal. 
<p>
   <kbd>HIGH-VALUE/HIGH-VALUES</kbd> 
       Represents one or more occurrences of the character that has the 
       highest ordinal position in the collating sequence used.  For the 
       EBCDIC collating sequence, the character is X'FF'; for other collating 
       sequences, the actual character used depends on the collating 
       sequence.  HIGH-VALUE is treated as a nonnumeric literal. 
<p>
   <kbd>LOW-VALUE/LOW-VALUES</kbd> 
       Represents one or more occurrences of the character that has the 
       lowest ordinal position in the collating sequence used.  For the 
       EBCDIC collating sequence, the character is X'00'; for other collating 
       sequences, the actual character used depends on the collating 
       sequence.  LOW-VALUE is treated as a nonnumeric literal. 
<p>
   <kbd>QUOTE/QUOTES</kbd> 
       Represents one or more occurrences of the quotation mark character. 
       QUOTE or QUOTES cannot be used in place of a quotation mark to enclose 
       a nonnumeric literal. 
<p>
       Represents one or more occurrences of a nonnumeric literal delimiter 
 x     depending on the QUOTE/APOST compiler option. 
<p>
   <kbd>symbolic-character</kbd> 
 |     Represents one or more of the characters specified as the value of the 
 |     symbolic-character in the SYMBOLIC CHARACTERS clause of the 
 |     SPECIAL-NAMES paragraph. 
<p>
   <kbd>ALL</kbd> literal 
       Represents one or more occurrences of the string of characters 
       composing the literal.  The literal must be either a nonnumeric 
       literal or a figurative constant other than the ALL literal.  When a 
       figurative constant other than ALL literal is used, the word ALL is 
       redundant and is used for readability only.  The figurative constant 
       ALL literal must not be used with the INSPECT, STOP, or STRING 
       statements. 
<p>
       <B>Note:</B>  The figurative constant ALL literal, when associated with a 
       numeric or numeric-edited item and when the length of the literal is 
 |     greater than one, is an obsolete element and will be deleted from the 
 |     next revision of the COBOL 85 Standard. 
<p>
 x <kbd>NULL/NULLS</kbd> 
 x     Represents a value used to indicate that data items defined with USAGE 
 x     IS POINTER or ADDRESS OF special registers do not contain a valid 
 x     address.  NULL can be used only where explicitly allowed in the syntax 
 x     format.  In VS COBOL II, NULL has the value of zero. 
<p>
   The singular and plural forms of a figurative constant other than 
   symbolic-character are equivalent, and can be used interchangeably.  For 
   example, if <tt>DATA-NAME-1</tt> is a 5-character data item, each of the following 
   statements will fill <tt>DATA-NAME-1</tt> with five spaces: 
<p>
         <samp>MOVE</samp> <samp>SPACE</samp>       <samp>TO</samp>  <samp>DATA-NAME-1</samp> 
         <samp>MOVE</samp> <samp>SPACES</samp>      <samp>TO</samp>  <samp>DATA-NAME-1</samp> 
         <samp>MOVE</samp> <samp>ALL</samp> <samp>SPACES</samp>  <samp>TO</samp>  <samp>DATA-NAME-1</samp> 
<p>
   A figurative constant can be used wherever &quot;literal&quot; appears in a syntax 
   diagram, except where explicitly prohibited.  When a numeric literal 
   appears in a syntax diagram, only the figurative constant ZERO (ZEROS, 
   ZEROES) can be used. 
<p>
   The length of a figurative constant depends on the context of the program. 
   The following rules apply: 
<p>
   o   When a figurative constant is specified in a VALUE clause or 
       associated with a data item (for example, when it is moved to or 
       compared with another item), the length of the figurative constant 
 |     character-string is equal to 1 or to the number of characters in the 
 |     associated data item, whichever is greater. 
<p>
   o   When a figurative constant, other than ALL literal, is not associated 
       with another data item (for example, in a STOP, STRING, or UNSTRING 
 |     statement), the length of the character-string is 1 character.

<A NAME=1.1.1.9><H3> 1.1.1.9   Special Registers</H3></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   <B>Special</B> <B>registers</B> are reserved words that name storage areas generated by 
 | the compiler.  Their primary use is to store information produced through 
 | specific COBOL features.  Each such storage area has a fixed name, and 
 | need not be defined within the program. 
<p>
 | In the general formats of this specification, a special register can be 
 | used wherever a data-name or identifier is specified, provided that the 
 | special register is the same category as the data-name or identifier, and 
 | the use of a special register is not explicitly prohibited.  If 
 | qualification is allowed, special registers can be qualified as necessary 
 | to provide uniqueness.  (For more information, see <A HREF=#1.5.1.1>&quot;Qualification&quot; in</A> 
 | <A HREF=#1.5.1.1>topic 1.5.1.1</A>.) 
<p>
   For the first call to a program, the compiler initializes the special 
   register fields to their initial values. The special registers will be 
   reset to their initial values in subsequent calls to a program that had 
   been canceled or that possesses the INITIAL attribute.  Otherwise, the 
   special registers will not be reset (they will be unchanged from the value 
   contained on the previous call). 
<p>
 | The following individual special registers are described below. 
<p>
 | o   ADDRESS OF 
 | o   DEBUG-ITEM 
 | o   LENGTH OF 
 | o   LINAGE-COUNTER 
 | o   RETURN-CODE 
 | o   SHIFT-OUT and SHIFT-IN

 x <kbd>ADDRESS</kbd> <kbd>OF</kbd> <kbd>Special</kbd> <kbd>Register</kbd> 
 x     The ADDRESS OF special register exists for each record (01 or 77) in 
 x     the Linkage Section, except for those records that redefine each 
 x     other.  In such cases, the ADDRESS OF special register is similarly 
 x     redefined. 
<p>
 x     The ADDRESS OF special register is implicitly defined USAGE IS 
 x     POINTER. 
<p>
   <kbd>DEBUG-ITEM</kbd> <kbd>Special</kbd> <kbd>Register</kbd> 
       The DEBUG-ITEM special register provides information for a debugging 
       declarative procedure about the conditions causing debugging section 
       execution. 
<p>
       <B>Note:</B>  The DEBUG-ITEM special register is an obsolete language element 
 |     and will be deleted from the next revision of the COBOL 85 Standard.

<p>
       Before each debugging section is executed, DEBUG-ITEM is filled with 
       spaces.  The contents of the DEBUG-ITEM subfields are updated 
       according to the rules for the MOVE statement, with one exception: 
       DEBUG-CONTENTS is updated as if the move were an 
       alphanumeric-to-alphanumeric elementary move without conversion of 
       data from one form of internal representation to another. 
<p>
       After updating, each field contains: 
<p>
       <kbd>DEBUG-LINE</kbd> 
           The source-statement sequence number (or the compiler-generated 
           sequence number, depending on the compiler option chosen) that 
           caused execution of the debugging section. 
<p>
       <kbd>DEBUG-NAME</kbd> 
           The first 30 characters of the name that caused execution of the 
           debugging section.  Any qualifiers are separated by the word &quot;OF.&quot; 
<p>
       <kbd>DEBUG-SUB-1,</kbd> <kbd>DEBUG-SUB-2,</kbd> <kbd>DEBUG-SUB-3</kbd> 
           If the DEBUG-NAME is subscripted or indexed, the occurrence number 
           of each level is entered in the respective DEBUG-SUB-n.  If the 
           item is <I>not</I> subscripted or indexed, these fields remain as spaces. 
           You should not reference the DEBUG-ITEM special register if your 
           program uses more than three levels of subscripting or indexing. 
<p>
       <kbd>DEBUG-CONTENTS</kbd> 
           Data is moved into DEBUG-CONTENTS, as shown in Table 4.

 x <kbd>LENGTH</kbd> <kbd>OF</kbd> <kbd>Special</kbd> <kbd>Register</kbd> 
 x     The LENGTH OF special register contains the number of bytes used by an 
 x     identifier. 
<p>
 x     LENGTH OF creates an implicit special register whose content is equal 
 x     to the current byte length of the data item referenced by the 
 x     identifier. 
<p>
 x     <B>Note:</B>  For DBCS data items, each character occupies 2 bytes of 
 x     storage. 
<p>
 x     LENGTH OF can be used in the Procedure Division anywhere a numeric 
 x     data item having the same definition as the implied definition of the 
 x     LENGTH OF special register is used.  The LENGTH OF special register 
 x     has the implicit definition: 
<p>
 x           <samp>USAGE</samp> <samp>IS</samp> <samp>BINARY</samp>   <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>9(9)</samp> 
<p>
 x     If the data item referenced by the identifier contains the GLOBAL 
 x     clause, the LENGTH OF special register is a global data item. 
<p>
 x     The LENGTH OF special register can appear within either the starting 
 x     character position or the length expressions of a reference 
 x     modification specification.  However, the LENGTH OF special register 
 x     cannot be applied to any operand that is reference modified. 
<p>
 x     LENGTH OF can <B>not</B> be either of the following: 
<p>
 x     o   A receiving data item 
 x     o   A subscript. 
<p>
 x     When the LENGTH OF special register is used as a parameter in a CALL 
 x     statement, the parameter must be a BY CONTENT parameter. 
<p>
 x     When a table element is specified, the LENGTH OF special register 
 x     contains the length, in bytes, of one occurrence.  When referring to a 
 x     table element, it need not be subscripted. 
<p>
 x     A value is returned for any identifier whose length can be determined, 
 x     even if the area referenced by the identifier is currently not 
 x     available to the program. 
<p>
 x     A separate LENGTH OF special register exists for each identifier 
 x     referenced with the LENGTH OF phrase.  For example: 
<p>
 x           <samp>MOVE</samp> <samp>LENGTH</samp> <samp>OF</samp> <samp>A</samp> <samp>TO</samp> <samp>B</samp> 
 x           <samp>DISPLAY</samp> <samp>LENGTH</samp> <samp>OF</samp> <samp>A,</samp> <samp>A</samp> 
 x           <samp>ADD</samp> <samp>LENGTH</samp> <samp>OF</samp> <samp>A</samp> <samp>TO</samp> <samp>B</samp> 
 x           <samp>CALL</samp> <samp>&quot;PROGX&quot;</samp> <samp>USING</samp> <samp>BY</samp> <samp>REFERENCE</samp> <samp>A</samp> <samp>BY</samp> <samp>CONTENT</samp> <samp>LENGTH</samp> <samp>OF</samp> <samp>A</samp> 
<p>
   <kbd>LINAGE-COUNTER</kbd> <kbd>Special</kbd> <kbd>Register</kbd> 
       A separate LINAGE-COUNTER special register is generated for each FD 
       entry containing a LINAGE clause.  When more than one is generated, 
       you must qualify each LINAGE-COUNTER with its related file-name. 
<p>
       The implicit description of the LINAGE-COUNTER special register is one 
       of the following: 
<p>
 |     o   If the LINAGE clause specifies a data-name, LINAGE-COUNTER has the 
           same PICTURE and USAGE as that data-name. 
<p>
       o   If the LINAGE clause specifies an integer, LINAGE-COUNTER is a 
           binary item with the same number of digits as that integer. 
<p>
       For more information, see the description of the LINAGE Clause on 
       topic <A HREF=#2.6.9>2.6.9</A>. 
<p>
       The value in LINAGE-COUNTER at any given time is the line number at 
       which the device is positioned within the current page. 
       LINAGE-COUNTER can be referred to in Procedure Division statements; it 
       must not be modified by them. 
<p>
       LINAGE-COUNTER is initialized to 1 when an OPEN statement for this 
       file is executed. 
<p>
       LINAGE-COUNTER is automatically modified by any WRITE statement for 
       this file.  (See <A HREF=#3.38>&quot;WRITE Statement&quot; in topic 3.38</A>.) 
<p>
       If the file description entry for a sequential file contains the 
       LINAGE clause and the EXTERNAL clause, the LINAGE-COUNTER data item is 
       an external data item.  If the file description entry for a sequential 
       file contains the LINAGE clause and the GLOBAL clause, the 
       LINAGE-COUNTER data item is a global data item. 
<p>
 x <kbd>RETURN-CODE</kbd> <kbd>Special</kbd> <kbd>Register</kbd> <kbd>(1)</kbd> 
 x     You can use the RETURN-CODE special register to pass return codes from 
 x     called programs to calling programs. 
<p>
 x     For separately compiled programs, the RETURN-CODE special register is 
 x     used to pass return codes from a subprogram to a main program and from 
 x     a main program to the operating system. 
<p>
 x     For nested programs, the RETURN-CODE special register is treated like 
 x     a numeric data item declared with the GLOBAL attribute in the 
 x     outermost program.  Unlike separately compiled programs, when nested 
 x     programs are invoked, the RETURN-CODE special register is not 
 x     initialized to zero. 
<p>
 x     The RETURN-CODE special register has the implicit definition: 
<p>
 x       <samp>01</samp>  <samp>RETURN-CODE</samp>  <samp>GLOBAL</samp>  <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>S9(4)</samp>  <samp>USAGE</samp> <samp>BINARY</samp>  <samp>VALUE</samp> <samp>ZERO.</samp> 
<p>
 x     Here is an example of how to set the RETURN-CODE special register: 
<p>
 x           <samp>MOVE</samp> <samp>8</samp> <samp>to</samp> <samp>RETURN-CODE</samp> 
<p>
 x <kbd>SHIFT-OUT</kbd> <kbd>and</kbd> <kbd>SHIFT-IN</kbd> <kbd>Special</kbd> <kbd>Register</kbd> <kbd>(1)</kbd> 
 x     The SHIFT-OUT and SHIFT-IN special registers are implicitly defined as 
 x     alphanumeric data items of the format: 
<p>
 x       <samp>01</samp>  <samp>SHIFT-OUT</samp>  <samp>GLOBAL</samp>  <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>X(1)</samp>  <samp>USAGE</samp> <samp>DISPLAY</samp>  <samp>VALUE</samp> <samp>X&quot;0E&quot;.</samp> 
 x       <samp>01</samp>  <samp>SHIFT-IN</samp>   <samp>GLOBAL</samp>  <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>X(1)</samp>  <samp>USAGE</samp> <samp>DISPLAY</samp>  <samp>VALUE</samp> <samp>X&quot;0F&quot;.</samp> 
<p>
 x     These special registers represent shift-out and shift-in control 
 x     characters without the use of unprintable characters. 
<p>
 x     These special registers cannot be receiving items.  SHIFT-OUT and 
 x     SHIFT-IN cannot be used in place of the keyboard control characters 
 x     when defining DBCS user-defined words and when specifying DBCS 
 x     literals. 
<p>
 x     Following is an example of how SHIFT-OUT and SHIFT-IN might be used: 
<p>
 x       <samp>DATA</samp> <samp>DIVISION.</samp>

<p>
 x <kbd>SORT-CONTROL</kbd> <kbd>Special</kbd> <kbd>Register</kbd> <kbd>(1)</kbd> 
 x     The SORT-CONTROL special register is the name of an alphanumeric data 
 x     item, which is implicitly defined as: 
<p>
 x       <samp>01</samp>  <samp>SORT-CONTROL</samp>  <samp>GLOBAL</samp>  <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>X(8)</samp> <samp>USAGE</samp> <samp>DISPLAY</samp> <samp>VALUE</samp> <samp>&quot;IGZSRTCD&quot;.</samp> 
<p>
 x     It contains the ddname of the data set that holds the control 
 x     statements used to improve the performance of a sorting or merging 
 x     operation. 
<p>
 x     The SORT-CONTROL special register is not necessary for a successful 
 x     sorting or merging operation. 
<p>
 x     Under MVS, you can provide a DD statement for the data set identified 
 x     by the SORT-CONTROL special register, and VS COBOL II will attempt to 
 x     open the data set at execution time.  Any error will be diagnosed with 
 x     an informational message. 
<p>
 x     Under VSE, you can specify the name of a VSE library member under the 
 x     SORT-CONTROL special register, and VS COBOL II will read the member at 
 x     execution time.  Alternatively, you can specify that SYSIPT is to be 
 x     read at execution time. 
<p>
 x     Note that the sort control file takes precedence over the SORT special 
 x     registers. 
<p>

 x <kbd>SORT-CORE-SIZE</kbd> <kbd>Special</kbd> <kbd>Register</kbd> <kbd>(1)</kbd> 
 x     The SORT-CORE-SIZE special register is the name of a binary data item 
 x     that you can use to specify the number of bytes of storage available 
 x     to the sort utility.  It has the implicit definition: 
<p>
 x       <samp>01</samp>  <samp>SORT-CORE-SIZE</samp>  <samp>GLOBAL</samp>  <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>S9(8)</samp>  <samp>USAGE</samp> <samp>BINARY</samp>  <samp>VALUE</samp> <samp>ZERO.</samp> 
<p>
 x     Under MVS and CMS, SORT-CORE-SIZE can be used in place of the MAINSIZE 
 x     or RESINV control statements in the sort control file. 
<p>
 x         The 'MAINSIZE=' option control statement keyword is equivalent to 
 x         SORT-CORE-SIZE with a positive value. 
<p>
 x         The 'RESINV=' option control statement keyword is equivalent to 
 x         SORT-CORE-SIZE with a negative value. 
<p>
 x         The 'MAINSIZE=MAX' option control statement keyword is equivalent 
 x         to SORT-CORE-SIZE with a value of +999999 or +99999999. 
<p>
 x     Under VSE, only a positive value can be specified, and it is 
 x     equivalent to the STORAGE = option control statement for Sort/Merge 
 x     II. 
<p>
 x <kbd>SORT-FILE-SIZE</kbd> <kbd>Special</kbd> <kbd>Register</kbd> <kbd>(1)</kbd> 
 x     The SORT-FILE-SIZE special register is the name of a binary data item 
 x     that you can use to specify the estimated number of records in the 
 x     sort input file, file-name-1.  It has the implicit definition: 
<p>
 x       <samp>01</samp>  <samp>SORT-FILE-SIZE</samp>  <samp>GLOBAL</samp>  <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>S9(8)</samp>  <samp>USAGE</samp> <samp>BINARY</samp>  <samp>VALUE</samp> <samp>ZERO.</samp> 
<p>
 x     Under MVS and CMS, SORT-FILE-SIZE is equivalent to the 'FILSZ=Ennn' 
 x     control statement in the sort control file.  Under VSE, the special 
 x     register is equivalent to the SIZE= keyword in the SORT control 
 x     statement of Sort/Merge II.  The SIZE= keyword is provided for 
 x     compatibility with previous releases of Sort/Merge II and is no longer 
 x     used. 
<p>
 x <kbd>SORT-MESSAGE</kbd> <kbd>Special</kbd> <kbd>Register</kbd> <kbd>(1)</kbd> 
 x     The SORT-MESSAGE special register is the name of an alphanumeric data 
 x     item that is available to both sort and merge programs.  Under MVS and 
 x     CMS, it has the implicit definition: 
<p>
 x       <samp>01</samp>  <samp>SORT-MESSAGE</samp>  <samp>GLOBAL</samp>  <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>X(8)</samp> <samp>USAGE</samp> <samp>DISPLAY</samp> <samp>VALUE</samp> <samp>&quot;SYSOUT&quot;.</samp> 
<p>
 x     The SORT-MESSAGE special register allows you to specify the ddname of 
 x     a data set that the sort utility should use in place of the SYSOUT 
 x     data set.  The ddname specified in SORT-MESSAGE is equivalent to the 
 x     name specified on the 'MSGDDN= ' control statement in the sort control 
 x     file.  Under VSE, the SORT-MESSAGE special register is equivalent to 
 x     the 'ROUTE= ' option control statement keyword. 
<p>
 x <kbd>SORT-MODE-SIZE</kbd> <kbd>Special</kbd> <kbd>Register</kbd> <kbd>(1)</kbd> 
 x     The SORT-MODE-SIZE special register is the name of a binary data item 
 x     that you can use to specify the length of variable-length records that 
 x     occur most frequently.  It has the implicit definition: 
<p>
 x       <samp>01</samp>  <samp>SORT-MODE-SIZE</samp>  <samp>GLOBAL</samp>  <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>S9(5)</samp>  <samp>USAGE</samp> <samp>BINARY</samp>  <samp>VALUE</samp> <samp>ZERO.</samp> 
<p>
 x     SORT-MODE-SIZE is equivalent to the 'SMS= ' control statement in the 
 x     sort control file. 
<p>
 x <kbd>SORT-RETURN</kbd> <kbd>Special</kbd> <kbd>Register</kbd> <kbd>(1)</kbd> 
 x     The SORT-RETURN special register is the name of a binary data item and 
 x     is available to both sort and merge programs. 
<p>
 x     The SORT-RETURN special register has the implicit definition: 
<p>
 x       <samp>01</samp>  <samp>SORT-RETURN</samp>  <samp>GLOBAL</samp>  <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>S9(4)</samp>  <samp>USAGE</samp> <samp>BINARY</samp>  <samp>VALUE</samp> <samp>ZERO.</samp> 
<p>
 x     It contains a return code of 0 (successful) or 16 (unsuccessful) at 
 x     the completion of a sort/merge operation.  If the sort/merge is 
 x     unsuccessful and there is no reference to this special register 
 x     anywhere in the program, a message is displayed on the console. 
<p>
 x     You can set the SORT-RETURN special register to 16 in an error 
 x     declarative or input/output procedure to terminate a sort/merge 
 x     operation before all records are processed.  The operation is 
 x     terminated on the next RETURN or RELEASE (generated by the compiler) 
 x     statement. 
<p>
 x <kbd>TALLY</kbd> <kbd>Special</kbd> <kbd>Register</kbd> <kbd>(1)</kbd> 
 x     The TALLY special register is the name of a binary data item with the 
 x     following definition: 
<p>
 x       <samp>01</samp>  <samp>TALLY</samp>  <samp>GLOBAL</samp>  <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>9(5)</samp>  <samp>USAGE</samp> <samp>BINARY</samp>  <samp>VALUE</samp> <samp>ZERO.</samp> 
<p>
 x     You can refer to or modify the contents of TALLY. 
<p>
 x <kbd>WHEN-COMPILED</kbd> <kbd>Special</kbd> <kbd>Register</kbd> <kbd>(1)</kbd> 
 x     The WHEN-COMPILED special register contains the date at the start of 
 x     the compilation.  WHEN-COMPILED is an alphanumeric data item with the 
 x     implicit definition: 
<p>
 x       <samp>01</samp>  <samp>WHEN-COMPILED</samp>  <samp>GLOBAL</samp>  <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>X(16)</samp>  <samp>USAGE</samp> <samp>DISPLAY.</samp> 
<p>
 x     The WHEN-COMPILED special register has the format: 
<p>
 x       <samp>MM/DD/YYhh.mm.ss</samp> <samp>(MONTH/DAY/YEARhour.minute.second)</samp> 
<p>
 x     For example, if compilation began at 2:04 PM on 15 May 1986, 
 x     WHEN-COMPILED would contain the value 05/15/8614.04.00. 
<p>
 x     WHEN-COMPILED can only be used as the sending field in a MOVE 
 x     statement.  WHEN-COMPILED special register data cannot be 
 x     reference-modified.

<p>
   A <B>nonnumeric</B> <B>literal</B> is a character-string enclosed in quotation marks 
   (&quot;), and can contain any allowable character from the character set of the 
   computer.  The maximum length of a nonnumeric literal is 160 characters. 
<p>
   The enclosing quotation marks are excluded from the literal when the 
   program is compiled.  An embedded quotation mark must be represented by a 
   pair of quotation marks (&quot;&quot;).  For example,      <tt>&quot;THIS</tt> <tt>ISN&quot;&quot;T</tt> <tt>WRONG&quot;</tt> 
<p>
 x A nonnumeric literal can be enclosed in apostrophes (').  If the APOST 
 x option is specified, these apostrophes are excluded from the literal when 
 x the program is compiled.  An embedded apostrophe must be represented by a 
 x pair of apostrophes ('').  For example,     <tt>'THIS</tt> <tt>ISN''T</tt> <tt>WRONG'</tt> 
<p>
   Any punctuation characters included within a nonnumeric literal are part 
   of the value of the literal. 
<p>
   Every <B>nonnumeric</B> literal is in the <B>alphanumeric</B> data category.  (Data 
   categories are described in <A HREF=#2.5.3.5>&quot;Classes and Categories of Data&quot; in</A> 
   <A HREF=#2.5.3.5>topic 2.5.3.5</A>.) 
<p>
 x Under the DBCS compiler option, the X'0E' and X'0F' in a nonnumeric 
 x literal will be recognized as shift codes for DBCS characters.  That is, 
 x the characters between paired shift codes will be recognized as DBCS 
 x characters.  Unlike a nonnumeric literal compiled under the NODBCS option, 
 x additional syntax rules apply to DBCS characters in a nonnumeric literal. 
 x These nonnumeric literals with double-byte characters have the following 
 x format:

 x <kbd>&lt;</kbd> 
 x     Represents the shift-out control character (X'0E') 
<p>
 x <kbd>&gt;</kbd> 
 x     Represents the shift-in control character (X'0F') 
<p>
 x Shift-out and shift-in control characters are part of the literal and must 
 x be paired with zero or an even number of intervening bytes.  Nested shift 
 x codes are not allowed in the DBCS portion of the literal. 
<p>
 x The syntax rules for EBCDIC parts of the literal follow the rules for 
 x nonnumeric literals.  The syntax rules for DBCS parts of the literal 
 x follow the rules for DBCS literals.  The move and comparison rules for 
 x nonnumeric literals with double-byte characters are the same as those for 
 x any nonnumeric literal. 
<p>
 x The length of a nonnumeric literal with double-byte characters is its byte 
 x length, including the shift control characters.  The maximum length is 
 x limited by the available space on one line in Area B.  A nonnumeric 
 x literal with double-byte characters cannot be continued.  A nonnumeric 
 x literal with double-byte characters is of the alphanumeric category. 
<p>
 x VS COBOL II statements process nonnumeric literals with double-byte 
 x characters without sensitivity to the shift codes and character codes. 
 x The use of statements that operate on a byte-to-byte basis (for example, 
 x STRING and UNSTRING) may result in strings that are not valid mixtures of 
 x EBCDIC and double-byte characters.  It is the user's responsibility to be 
 x certain that the statements are used correctly.  See <cite>VS</cite> <cite>COBOL</cite> <cite>II</cite>

<p>
   A <B>numeric</B> <B>literal</B> is a character-string whose characters are selected from 
   the digits 0 through 9, a sign character (+ or -), and the decimal point. 
   If the literal contains no decimal point, it is an integer.  (In this 
   manual, the word <B>integer</B> appearing in a format represents a numeric 
   literal of nonzero value that contains no sign and no decimal point; any 
   other restrictions are included with the description of the format.)  The 
   following rules apply: 
<p>
   o   One through 18 digits are allowed. 
<p>
   o   Only one sign character is allowed.  If included, it must be the 
       leftmost character of the literal.  If the literal is unsigned, it is 
       positive in value. 
<p>
   o   Only one decimal point is allowed.  If a decimal point is included, it 
       is treated as an assumed decimal point (that is, as not taking up a 
       character position in the literal).  The decimal point can appear 
       anywhere within the literal except as the rightmost character. 
<p>
   The value of a numeric literal is the algebraic quantity expressed by the 
   characters in the literal.  The size of a numeric literal in standard data 
   format characters is equal to the number of digits specified by the user.

 x o   The sign is optional before the mantissa and the exponent;  if you 
 x     omit the sign, the compiler assumes a positive number. 
<p>
 x o   The mantissa can contain between 1 and 16 digits.  A decimal point 
 x     must be included in the mantissa. 
<p>
 x o   The exponent is represented by an E followed by an optional sign and 
 x     one or two digits. 
<p>
 x o   The magnitude of a floating-point literal value must fall between 
 x     0.54E-78 and 0.72E+76.  For values outside of this range, an E-level

       The separator period must be used only to indicate the end of a 
       sentence, or as shown in formats.  The separator comma and separator 
       semicolon can be used anywhere the separator space is used. 
<p>
       o   In the <B>Identification</B> <B>Division</B>, separator commas and separator 
           semicolons can be used in the comment-entries.  Each paragraph 
           must end with a separator period. 
<p>
       o   In the <B>Environment</B> <B>Division</B>, separator commas or separator 
           semicolons can separate clauses and operands within clauses.  The 
           SOURCE-COMPUTER, OBJECT-COMPUTER, SPECIAL-NAMES, and I-O-CONTROL 
           paragraphs must each end with a separator period.  In the 
           FILE-CONTROL paragraph, each File-Control entry must end with a 
           separator period. 
<p>
       o   In the <B>Data</B> <B>Division</B>, separator commas or separator semicolons can 
           separate clauses and operands within clauses. File (FD), 
           Sort/Merge file (SD), and data description entries must each end 
           with a separator period. 
<p>
       o   In the <B>Procedure</B> <B>Division</B>, separator commas or separator 
           semicolons can separate statements within a sentence, and operands 
           within a statement.  Each sentence and each procedure must end 
           with a separator period.

       of left and right parentheses.  They delimit subscripts, 
       reference-modifiers, arithmetic expressions, or conditions. 
<p>
   <kbd>Colon</kbd> <kbd>[</kbd> <kbd>:</kbd> <kbd>]</kbd> 
       The colon is a separator and is required when shown in general 
       formats. 
<p>

       An opening quotation mark must be immediately preceded by a space or a 
       left parenthesis.  A closing quotation mark must be immediately 
       followed by a separator (space, comma, semicolon, period, or right 
       parenthesis).  Quotation marks must appear as balanced pairs.  They 
       delimit nonnumeric literals, except when the literal is continued (see 
       <A HREF=#1.3.4.2>&quot;Continuation Lines&quot; in topic 1.3.4.2</A>).

 x     option is chosen. 
<p>
 x <kbd>Apostrophes</kbd> <kbd>[']</kbd> <kbd>...</kbd> <kbd>[']</kbd> 
 x     An opening apostrophe must be immediately preceded by a space or a 
 x     left parenthesis.  A closing apostrophe must be immediately followed 
 x     by a separator (space, comma, semicolon, period, or right 
 x     parenthesis).  Apostrophes must appear as balanced pairs.  They 
 x     delimit nonnumeric literals, except when the literal is continued (see 
 x     <A HREF=#1.3.4.2>&quot;Continuation Lines&quot; in topic 1.3.4.2</A>). 
<p>
 x     Apostrophes are not treated as separators when the QUOTE compiler

<p>
   <kbd>Pseudo-text</kbd> <kbd>delimiters</kbd> <kbd>[�==]</kbd> <kbd>.</kbd> <kbd>.</kbd> <kbd>.</kbd> <kbd>[==�]</kbd> 
       An opening pseudo-text delimiter must be immediately preceded by a 
       space.  A closing pseudo-text delimiter must be immediately followed 
       by a separator (space, comma, semicolon, or period).  Pseudo-text 
       delimiters must appear as balanced pairs.  They delimit pseudo-text.

<A NAME=1.3.3.6><H3> 1.3.3.6   End Program Header</H3></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   The end program header is a combination of words, followed by a separator 
   period, that indicates the end of a COBOL source program.  For example: 
<p>
     <samp>END</samp> <samp>PROGRAM</samp> <samp>PROGRAM-NAME.</samp> 
<p>
   Program-name must be identical to the program-name of the corresponding 
   PROGRAM-ID paragraph.  Every COBOL program, except an outermost program 
   that contains no nested programs and is not followed by another batch 
   program, must end with an END PROGRAM header.

</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   Any sentence, entry, clause, or phrase that requires more than one line 
   can be continued in Area B of the next line that is neither a comment line 
   nor a blank line.  The line being continued is a <B>continued</B> <B>line</B>; the 
   succeeding lines are <B>continuation</B> <B>lines</B>.  Area A of a continuation line 
   must be blank. 
<p>
 x DBCS literals cannot be continued. 
<p>
 x Both characters making up the opening delimiter for the hexadecimal 
 x notation of a nonnumeric literal, X&quot; or X' (if the compiler option APOST 
 x is specified), must be on the same line. 
<p>
   If there is no hyphen (-) in the indicator area (column 7) of a line, the 
   last character of the preceding line is assumed to be followed by a space. 
<p>
   If there is a hyphen in the indicator area of a line, the first nonblank 
   character of this continuation line immediately follows the last nonblank 
   character of the continued line without an intervening space. 
<p>
   If the continued line contains a nonnumeric literal without a closing 
   quotation mark, all spaces at the end of the continued line (through 
   column 72) are considered to be part of the literal.  The continuation 
   line must contain a hyphen in the indicator area, and the first nonblank 
   character must be a quotation mark.  The continuation of the literal 
   begins with the character immediately following the quotation mark. 
<p>
   If the last character on the continued line of a nonnumeric literal is a 
   single quotation mark in column 72, the continuation line must start with 
   two consecutive quotation marks.  This will result in a single quotation 
   mark as part of the value of the nonnumeric literal. 
<p>
 x If the last character on the continued line of a nonnumeric literal is a 
 x single quotation mark in Area B, the continuation line can start with a 
 x single quotation mark.  This will result in two consecutive nonnumeric 
 x literals instead of one continued nonnumeric literal. 
<p>
   Both characters making up the pseudo-text delimiter separator &quot;==&quot; must be 
   on the same line.

<pre width="80">
<p>
 | Names can have global or local attributes.  Some names are always global; 
 | other names are always local; and some other names are either local or 
 | global depending upon specifications in the program in which the names are 
 | declared. 
<p>
 | A program cannot reference any condition-name, data-name, file-name, or 
 | record-name declared in any program it contains. 
<p>
 | A <B>global</B> <B>name</B> may be used to refer to the object with which it is 
 | associated either from within the program in which the global name is 
 | declared or from within any other program which is contained in the 
 | program which declares the global name. 
<p>
 | A <B>local</B> <B>name</B>, however, may be used only to refer to the object with which 
 | it is associated from within the program in which the local name is 
 | declared. 
<p>
 | If a data-name, a file-name, record-name or a condition-name declared in a 
 | data description entry is not global, the name is local. 
<p>
 | <B>Note:</B>  Specific rules sometimes prohibit specification of the GLOBAL 
 | clause for certain data description, file description, or record 
 | description entries. 
<p>
 | <kbd>data-name</kbd> 
 |     A data-name is global if the GLOBAL clause is specified either in the 
 |     data description entry by which the data-name is declared or in 
 |     another entry to which that data description entry is subordinate. 
<p>
 | <kbd>file-name</kbd> 
 |     A file-name is global if the GLOBAL clause is specified in the file 
 |     description entry for that file-name. 
<p>
 | <kbd>record-name</kbd> 
 |     A record-name is global if the GLOBAL clause is specified in the 
 |     record description entry by which the record-name is declared or, in 
 |     the case of record description entries in the File Section, if the 
 |     GLOBAL clause is specified in the file description entry for the 
 |     file-name associated with the record description entry. 
<p>
 | <kbd>condition-name</kbd> 
 |     A condition-name, when declared in a data description entry, is global 
 |     if that entry is subordinate to another entry in which the GLOBAL 
 |     clause is specified. 
<p>
 |     A condition-name, when declared within the Configuration Section, is 
 |     always global. 
<p>
 | <kbd>program-name</kbd> 
 |     A program-name is neither local nor global.  See <A HREF=#1.4.5.1>&quot;Conventions for</A> 
 |     <A HREF=#1.4.5.1>Program-Names&quot; in topic 1.4.5.1</A>. 
<p>

<p>
 | <kbd>library-name</kbd> <kbd>and</kbd> <kbd>text-name</kbd> 
 |     These names are external to the program and can be referenced by any

<p>
 | <kbd>alphabet-name</kbd> 
 |     An alphabet-name is always global.

<p>
 | <kbd>symbolic-character</kbd> 
 |     A symbolic-character is always global. 
<p>
 | <kbd>index-name</kbd> 
 |     If a data item possessing the global attribute includes a table 
 |     accessed with an index, that index also possesses the global 
 |     attribute.  Therefore, the scope of an index-name is identical to that 
 |     of the data-name which names the table whose index is named by that 
 |     index-name and the scope of name rules for data-names apply. 
 |     Index-names cannot be qualified.

<pre width="80">
<p>
 | Accessible data items usually require that certain representations of data 
 | be stored.  File connectors usually require that certain information 
 | concerning files be stored.  The storage associated with a data item or a 
 | file connector may be <B>external</B> or <B>internal</B> to the program in which the 
 | object is declared. 
<p>
 | A data item or file connector is external if the storage associated with 
 | that object is associated with the run unit rather than with any 
 | particular program within the run unit.  An external object may be 
 | referenced by any program in the run unit which describes the object. 
 | References to an external object from different programs using separate 
 | descriptions of the object are always to the same object.  In a run unit, 
 | there is only one representative of an external object. 
<p>
 | An object is internal if the storage associated with that object is 
 | associated only with the program which describes the object. 
<p>
 | External and internal objects may have either global or local names. 
<p>
 | A data record described in the Working-Storage Section is given the 
 | external attribute by the presence of the EXTERNAL clause in its data 
 | description entry.  Any data item described by a data description entry 
 | subordinate to an entry describing an external record also attains the 
 | external attribute.  If a record or data item does not have the external 
 | attribute, it is part of the internal data of the program in which it is 
 | described. 
<p>
 | A file connector is given the external attribute by the presence of the 
 | EXTERNAL clause in the associated file description entry.  If the file 
 | connector does not have the external attribute, it is internal to the 
 | program in which the associated file-name is described. 
<p>
 | Two programs can reference the same file connector in the following 
 | circumstances: 
<p>
 | 1.  An external file connector can be referenced from any program that 
 |     describes that file connector. 
<p>
 | 2.  If a program is contained within another program, both programs can 
 |     refer to a global file connector by referring to an associated global 
 |     file-name either in the containing program, or in any program that 
 |     directly or indirectly contains the containing program. 
<p>
<p>
 | Two programs in a run unit can reference common data in the following 
 | circumstances: 
<p>
 | 1.  The data content of an external data record can be referenced from any 
 |     program provided that program has described that data record. 
<p>
 | 2.  If a program is contained within another program, both programs can 
 |     refer to data possessing the global attribute either in the containing 
 |     program, or in any program that directly or indirectly contains the 
 |     containing program. 
<p>
 | The data records described subordinate to a file description entry which 
 | does not contain the EXTERNAL clause or a sort-merge file description 
 | entry, as well as any data items described subordinate to the data 
 | description entries for such records, are always internal to the program 
 | describing the file-name.  If the EXTERNAL clause is included in the file 
 | description entry, the data records and the data items attain the external 
 | attribute. 
<p>
 | Data records and subordinate data items described in the Linkage Section 
 | of a program are always considered to be internal to the program 
 | describing that data.  Special considerations apply to data described in 
 | the Linkage Section whereby an association is made between the data 
 | records described and other data items accessible to other programs.

<pre width="80">
<p>
 | When a program, program B, is directly contained within another program, 
 | program A, both programs may define a condition-name, a data-name, a 
 | file-name, or a record-name using the same user-defined word.  When such a 
 | duplicated name is referenced in program B, the following rules are used 
 | to determine the referenced object. 
<p>
 | o   The referenced object is identified from the following set of names: 
<p>
 |     -   all names defined in program B 
 |     -   all <B>global</B> names defined in program A 
 |     -   all <B>global</B> names defined in any programs that directly or 
 |         indirectly contain program A. 
<p>
 |     Using this set of names, the normal rules for qualification and any 
 |     other rules for uniqueness of reference are applied until one or more 
 |     objects is identified. 
<p>
 | o   If only one object is identified, it is the referenced object. 
<p>
 | o   If more than one object is identified, no more than one of them can 
 |     have a name local to program B.  If zero or one of the objects has a 
 |     name local to program B, the following rules apply: 
<p>
 |     -   If the name is declared in program B, the object in program B is 
 |         the referenced object. 
<p>
 |     -   Otherwise, if program A is contained within another program, the 
 |         referenced object is: 
<p>
 |         -   The object in program A if the name is declared with the

<p>
 |         -   The object in the containing program if the name is not 
 |             declared in program A and is declared with the GLOBAL 
 |             attribute in the program containing program A.  This rule is

<p>
 | The program-name of a program is specified in the PROGRAM-ID paragraph of 
 | the program's Identification Division.  A program-name can be referenced 
 | only by the CALL statement, the CANCEL statement, or the END PROGRAM 
 | header.  Names of programs constituting a run unit are not necessarily 
 | unique, but when two programs in a run unit are identically named, at 
 | least one of those two programs must be directly or indirectly contained 
 | within another separately compiled program which does not contain the 
 | other of those two programs. 
<p>
 | A separately compiled program and all its <B>contained</B> programs must have 
 | unique program-names. 
<p>
 | The following rules regulate the scope of a program-name. 
<p>
 | o   If the program-name is that of a program which does not possess the 
 |     COMMON attribute and which is directly contained within another 
 |     program, that program-name can be referenced only by statements 
 |     included in that containing program. 
<p>
 | o   If the program-name is that of a program which does possess the COMMON 
 |     attribute and which is directly contained within another program, that 
 |     program-name can be referenced only by statements included in that 
 |     containing program and any programs directly or indirectly contained 
 |     within that containing program, except that program possessing the 
 |     COMMON attribute and any programs contained within it. 
<p>
 | o   If the program-name is that of a program which is separately compiled, 
 |     that program-name can be referenced by statements included in any 
 |     other program in the run unit, except programs it directly or 
 |     indirectly contains. 
<p>
 |     The mechanism used to determine which program to call is as follows: 
<p>
 |     -   If one of the two programs having the same name as that specified 
 |         in the CALL statement is directly contained within the program 
 |         which includes the CALL statement, that program is called. 
<p>
 |     -   If one of the two programs having the same name as that specified 
 |         in the CALL statement possesses the COMMON attribute and is 
 |         directly contained within another program which directly or 
 |         indirectly contains the program which includes the CALL statement, 
 |         that common program is called unless the calling program is 
 |         contained within that common program. 
<p>
 |     -   Otherwise, the separately compiled program is called.

<p>
 | Every user-defined name in a COBOL program is assigned, by the user, to 
 | name a resource which is to be used in solving a data processing problem. 
 | In order to use a resource, a statement in a COBOL program must contain a 
 | reference which uniquely identifies that resource.  In order to ensure 
 | uniqueness of reference, a user-defined name can be qualified, 
 | subscripted, or reference modified as described in the following

<p>
 | See <A HREF=#1.1.1.2>&quot;User-Defined Words&quot; in topic 1.1.1.2</A>. 
<p>
 | When the same name has been assigned in separate programs to two or more

 | the references in one of those programs to differentiate between the two 
 | identically named resources, then certain conventions which limit the 
 | scope of names apply.  These conventions ensure that the resource 
 | identified is that described in the program containing the reference.  For 
 | more information, see <A HREF=#1.4.5>&quot;Resolution of Names&quot; in topic 1.4.5</A>. 
<p>
 | Unless otherwise specified by the rules for a statement, any subscripting

<A NAME=1.5.1.1><H3>| 1.5.1.1   Qualification</H3></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
 | A name can be made unique if it exists within a hierarchy of names by 
 | specifying one or more higher-level names in the hierarchy.  The 
 | higher-level names are called <B>qualifiers</B>, and the process of using such 
 | names to make a unique reference is called <B>qualification</B>. 
<p>
 | Qualification is specified by placing one or more phrases after a 
 | user-specified name, with each phrase made up of the word IN or OF 
 | followed by a qualifier.  (IN and OF are logically equivalent.) 
<p>
 | In any hierarchy, the data-name associated with the highest level must be 
 | unique if it is referenced, and cannot be qualified. 
<p>
 | You must specify enough qualification to make the name unique; however, it 
 | is not always necessary to specify all the levels of the hierarchy.  For 
 | example, if there is more than one file whose records contain the field 
 | <tt>EMPLOYEE-NO</tt>, but only one of the files has a record named <tt>MASTER-RECORD</tt>, 
 | then: 
<p>
 | o   <tt>EMPLOYEE-NO</tt> <tt>OF</tt> <tt>MASTER-RECORD</tt> sufficiently qualifies  <tt>EMPLOYEE-NO</tt> 
 | o   <tt>EMPLOYEE-NO</tt> <tt>OF</tt> <tt>MASTER-RECORD</tt> <tt>OF</tt> <tt>MASTER-FILE</tt> is valid but unnecessary. 
<p>
<p>
 | The rules for qualifying a name are: 
<p>
 | o   A name can be qualified even though it does not need qualification, 
 |     except in a REDEFINES clause, in which case it <B>must</B> <B>not</B> be qualified. 
<p>
 | o   Each qualifier must be of a higher level than the name it qualifies, 
 |     and must be within the same hierarchy. 
<p>
 | o   If there is more than one combination of qualifiers that ensures 
 |     uniqueness, then any of these combinations can be used. 
<p>
 | If explicitly referenced, a condition-name must be unique or be made 
 | unique through qualification and/or subscripting except when the scope of 
 | names conventions by themselves ensure uniqueness of reference.  See 
 | <A HREF=#1.4>&quot;Scope of Names&quot; in topic 1.4</A>. 
<p>
 | If qualification is used to make a condition-name unique, the associated 
 | conditional variable can be used as the first qualifier.  If qualification 
 | is used, the hierarchy of names associated with the conditional variable 
 | itself must be used to make the condition-name unique.

 |     The conditional variable for condition-name-1 must contain an OCCURS 
 |     clause or must be subordinate to a data description entry which 
 |     contains an OCCURS clause. 
<p>
 | <kbd>data-name-1</kbd> 
 |     Must contain an OCCURS clause or must be subordinate to a data 
 |     description entry which contains an OCCURS clause. 
<p>
 | <kbd>integer-1</kbd> 
 |     Can be signed.  If signed, it must be positive. 
<p>
 | <kbd>data-name-2</kbd> 
 |     Must be a numeric elementary item representing an integer. 
<p>
 |     Data-name-2 can be qualified. 
<p>
 | <kbd>index-name-1</kbd> 
 |     Corresponds to a data description entry in the hierarchy of the table 
 |     being referenced which contains an INDEXED BY phrase specifying that 
 |     name. 
<p>
 | <kbd>integer-2,</kbd> <kbd>integer-3</kbd> 
 |     Cannot be signed. 
<p>
 | The subscripts, enclosed in parentheses, are written immediately following 
 | any qualification for the name of the table element.  The number of 
 | subscripts in such a reference must equal the number of dimensions in the 
 | table whose element is being referenced.  That is, there must be a 
 | subscript for each OCCURS clause in the hierarchy containing the data-name 
 | including the data-name itself. 
<p>
 | When more than one subscript is required, they are written in the order of 
 | successively less inclusive dimensions of the data organization.  If a 
 | multi-dimensional table is thought of as a series of nested tables and the 
 | most inclusive or outermost table in the nest is considered to be the 
 | major table with the innermost or least inclusive table being the minor 
 | table, the subscripts are written from left to right in the order major, 
 | intermediate, and minor. 
<p>
 | For example, if <tt>TABLE-THREE</tt> is defined as:

<p>
 | a valid subscripted reference to <tt>TABLE-THREE</tt> is: 
<p>
 |       <samp>ELEMENT-THREE</samp> <samp>(2</samp> <samp>2</samp> <samp>1)</samp> 
<p>
 | Subscripted references may also be reference modified.  See the third 
 | example on topic <A HREF=#1.5.1.5.2>1.5.1.5.2</A>. 
<p>
 | A reference to an item must not be subscripted unless the item is a table 
 | element <B>or</B> an item or condition-name associated with a table element. 
<p>
 | Each table element reference must be subscripted except when such 
 | reference appears: 
<p>
 | o   In a USE FOR DEBUGGING statement 
<p>
 | o   As the subject of a SEARCH statement 
<p>
 | o   In a REDEFINES clause 
<p>
 | o   In the KEY is phrase of an OCCURS clause. 
<p>
 | The lowest permissible occurrence number represented by a subscript is 1.

 | maximum number of occurrences of the item as specified in the OCCURS 
 | clause.

<pre width="80">
<p>
 | Indexing allows such operations as table searching and manipulating 
 | specific items.  To use indexing you associate one or more index-names 
 | with an item whose data description entry contains an OCCURS clause.  An 
 | index associated with an index-name acts as a subscript, and its value 
 | corresponds to an occurrence number for the item to which the index-name 
 | is associated. 
<p>
 | The INDEXED BY phrase, by which the index-name is identified and 
 | associated with its table, is an optional part of the OCCURS clause. 
 | There is no separate entry to describe the index associated with 
 | index-name.  At object time, the contents of the index corresponds to an 
 | occurrence number for that specific dimension of the table with which the 
 | index is associated. 
<p>
 | The initial value of an index at object time is undefined, and the index 
 | must be initialized before it is used as a subscript.  An initial value is 
 | assigned to an index with one of the following: 
<p>
 | o   the PERFORM statement with the VARYING phrase 
 | o   the SEARCH statement with the ALL phrase 
 | o   the SET statement. 
<p>
 | The use of an integer or data-name as a subscript referencing a table 
 | element or an item within a table element does not cause the alteration of 
 | any index associated with that table. 
<p>
 | An index-name can be used to reference only the table to which it is 
 | associated by the INDEXED BY phrase. 
<p>
 | Data that is arranged in the form of a table is often searched.  The 
 | SEARCH statement provides facilities for producing serial and non-serial 
 | searches. It is used to search for a table element that satisfies a 
 | specific condition and to adjust the value of the associated index to 
 | indicate that table element. 
<p>
 | To be valid during execution, an index value must correspond to a table 
 | element occurrence of neither less than one, nor greater than the highest 
 | permissible occurrence number. 
<p>
 | Further information on index-names is given in the description of the 
 | INDEXED BY phrase of the OCCURS clause, on topic <A HREF=#2.7.6.1.2>2.7.6.1.2</A>.

<p>
 | If the data item referenced by data-name-1 is described as numeric,

 | Reference modification creates a unique data item which is a subset of the

<A NAME=1.6><H1> 1.6   Transfer of Control</H1></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   In the Procedure Division, unless there is an <B>explicit</B> control transfer or 
   there is no next executable statement, program flow transfers control from 
   statement to statement in the order in which the statements are written. 
   (See Note below.)  This normal program flow is an <B>implicit</B> transfer of 
   control. 
<p>
   In addition to the implicit transfers of control between consecutive 
   statements, implicit transfer of control also occurs when the normal flow 
   is altered without the execution of a procedure branching statement.  The 
   following examples show <B>implicit</B> transfers of control, overriding 
   statement-to-statement transfer of control: 
<p>
   o   After execution of the last statement of a procedure being executed 
       under control of another COBOL statement, control implicitly 
       transfers.  (COBOL statements that control procedure execution are, 
       for example:  MERGE, PERFORM, SORT, and USE.)  Further, if a paragraph 
       is being executed under the control of a PERFORM statement which 
       causes iterative execution, and that paragraph is the first paragraph 
       in the range of that PERFORM statement, an implicit transfer of 
       control occurs between the control mechanism associated with that 
       PERFORM statement and the first statement in that paragraph for each 
       iterative execution of the paragraph. 
<p>
   o   During SORT or MERGE statement execution, control is implicitly 
       transferred to an input or output procedure. 
<p>
   o   During execution of any COBOL statement that causes execution of a 
       declarative procedure, control is implicitly transferred to that 
       procedure. 
<p>
   o   At the end of execution of any declarative procedure, control is 
       implicitly transferred back to the control mechanism associated with 
       the statement that caused its execution. 
<p>
   COBOL also provides <B>explicit</B> control transfers through the execution of 
   any procedure branching, program call, or conditional statement.  (Lists 
   of procedure branching and conditional statements are contained in 
   <A HREF=#2.8>&quot;Procedure Division&quot; in topic 2.8</A>.) 
<p>
   <B>Note:</B>  The term &quot;next executable statement&quot; refers to the next COBOL 
   statement to which control is transferred, according to the rules given 
   above.  There is no <B>next</B> <B>executable</B> <B>statement</B> under these circumstances: 
<p>
   o   When the program contains no Procedure Division 
<p>
   o   Following the last statement in a declarative section when the 
       paragraph in which it appears is not being executed under the control 
       of some other COBOL statement 
<p>
   o   Following the last statement in a program when the paragraph in which 
       it appears is not being executed under the control of some other COBOL 
       statement in that program 
<p>
   o   Following the last statement in a declarative section when the 
       statement is in the range of an active PERFORM statement executed in a 
       different section and this last statement of the declarative section 
       is not also the last statement of the procedure that is the exit of 
       the active PERFORM statement 
<p>
 x o   Following a STOP RUN statement, EXIT PROGRAM statement or GOBACK 
       statement that transfers control outside the COBOL program 
<p>
   o   The end program header. 
<p>
   When there is no next executable statement and control is not transferred 
   outside the COBOL program, the program flow of control is undefined unless 
   the program execution is in the nondeclarative procedures portion of a 
   program under control of a CALL statement, in which case an implicit EXIT 
   PROGRAM statement is executed.

   <kbd>program-name</kbd> 
       A user-defined word that identifies your program.  The system uses the 
       first 8 characters of program-name of the outermost program as the 
       identifying name of the program. 
<p>
       The first 8 characters of program-name of the outermost program should 
       be unique within the system.  The first character must be alphabetic. 
       If the first character is not alphabetic, it is converted as follows: 
<p>
       o   1 through 9 are changed to A through I 
       o   Anything else is changed to J. 
<p>
       If a hyphen is used in characters 2 through 8 of the program-name of 
       the outermost program, it is changed to zero (0). 
<p>
       For programs that are contained within another program, program-name 
       can be any valid user-defined COBOL word, up to 30 characters long. 
 |     The first 8 characters need not be unique.  Lowercase and uppercase 
 |     letters are both valid, but they will be considered equivalent in 
 |     resolving which program is called or referenced. 
<p>
 x     The program-name can be a nonnumeric literal other than a figurative 
 x     constant.  The content of the literal must follow the rules for 
 x     formation of program names.  In the outermost program, the literal can 
 x     include the extension characters $, #, and @.  Any lower case

   <kbd>COMMON</kbd> 
 |     Specifies that the program named by program-name is contained within 
 |     another program, and can be called from siblings of the common program 
 |     and programs contained within them.  The COMMON clause can be used 
 |     only if the program named by program-name is contained within another 
       program.  For more information on conventions for program names, see 
       <cite>VS</cite> <cite>COBOL</cite> <cite>II</cite> <cite>Application</cite> <cite>Programming</cite> <cite>Guide</cite> <cite>for</cite> <cite>MVS</cite> <cite>and</cite> <cite>CMS</cite> or

<p>
   <kbd>INITIAL</kbd> 
       Specifies that when program-name is called, program-name and any 
       programs contained within it are placed in their initial state. 
<p>
       A program is in the initial state: 
<p>
       o   The first time the program is called in a run unit 
<p>
       o   Every time the program is called, if it possesses the initial 
           attribute 
<p>
       o   The first time the program is called after the execution of a 
           CANCEL statement referencing the program or a CANCEL statement 
           referencing a program that directly or indirectly contains the 
           program 
<p>
       o   The first time the program is called after the execution of a CALL 
           statement referencing a program that possesses the initial 
           attribute, and that directly or indirectly contains the program. 
<p>
       When a program is in the initial state, the following occur: 
<p>
       o   The program's internal data contained in the Working-Storage 
           Section are initialized.  If a VALUE clause is used in the 
           description of the data item, the data item is initialized to the 
           defined value.  If a VALUE clause is not associated with a data 
           item, the initial value of the data item is undefined. 
<p>
       o   Files with internal file connectors associated with the program 
           are not in the open mode. 
<p>
       o   The control mechanisms for all PERFORM statements contained in the 
           program are set to their initial states. 
<p>
       o   An altered GO TO statement contained in the program is set to its 
           initial state.

</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   The program-names allocated to programs constituting a run unit are not 
   necessarily unique but, when two programs in a run unit are identically 
   named, at least one of those two programs must be directly or indirectly 
   contained within another separately compiled program that does not contain 
   the other of those two programs. 
<p>
   The following rules regulate the scope of a program-name: 
<p>
   o   If the program-name is that of a program that does not possess the 
       COMMON attribute and that is directly contained within another 
       program, that program-name can be referenced only by statements 
       included in that containing program. 
<p>
   o   If the program-name is that of a program that does possess the COMMON 
       attribute and that is directly contained within another program, that 
       program-name can be referenced only by statements included in that 
       containing program and any programs directly or indirectly contained 
       within that containing program, except that program possessing the 
       COMMON attribute and any programs contained within it. 
<p>
   o   If the program-name is that of a program that is separately compiled, 
       that program-name can be referenced by statements included in any 
       other program in the run unit, except programs it directly or 
       indirectly contains.

   In addition, the Configuration Section can: 
<p>
   o   Relate IBM-defined environment-names to user-defined mnemonic names 
   o   Specify the collating sequence 
   o   Specify a substitution for the currency sign

           Activates a compile-time switch for debugging lines written in the 
           source program. 
<p>
           A debugging line is a statement that is compiled only when the 
           compile-time switch is activated. Debugging lines allow you, for 
           example, to check the value of a data-name at certain points in a 
           procedure. 
<p>
           To specify a debugging line in your program, code a 'D' in column 
           7 (indicator area).  You can include successive debugging lines, 
           but each must have a 'D' in column 7 and you cannot break 
           character strings across lines. 
<p>
           All your debugging lines must be written so that the program is 
           syntactically correct, whether the debugging lines are compiled or 
           treated as comments. 
<p>
           The presence or absence of the DEBUGGING MODE clause is logically 
           determined after all COPY and REPLACE statements have been 
           processed. 
<p>
           You can code debugging lines in the Environment (after the 
           OBJECT-COMPUTER paragraph), Data, or Procedure Divisions. 
<p>
           If a debugging line contains only spaces in Area A and in Area B, 
           it is treated the same as a blank line.

   <kbd>SEGMENT-LIMIT</kbd> <kbd>IS</kbd> 
       Certain permanent segments can be overlaid by independent segments 
       while still retaining the logical properties of <B>fixed</B> <B>portion</B> 
       segments. (Fixed portion segments are made up of fixed permanent and 
       fixed overlayable segments.) 
<p>
 |     <B>Note:</B>  SEGMENT-LIMIT is an obsolete element, and will be deleted from 
 |     the next revision of the COBOL 85 Standard. 
<p>
       <kbd>Priority-number</kbd> 
           An integer ranging from 1 through 49. 
<p>
           When SEGMENT-LIMIT is specified: 
<p>
           o   A fixed <B>permanent</B> segment is one with a priority-number less 
               than the priority-number specified. 
<p>
           o   A fixed <B>overlayable</B> segment is one with a priority-number 
               ranging from that specified through 49, inclusive. 
<p>
           For example, if SEGMENT-LIMIT IS 25 is specified: 
<p>
           o   Sections with priority-numbers 0 through 24 are fixed 
               <B>permanent</B> segments. 
<p>
           o   Sections with priority-numbers 25 through 49 are fixed 
               <B>overlayable</B> segments. 
<p>
           When SEGMENT-LIMIT is omitted, all sections with priority-numbers 
           0 through 49 are fixed permanent segments.

   <kbd>mnemonic-name-1,</kbd> <kbd>mnemonic-name-2</kbd> 
       Mnemonic-name-1 and mnemonic-name-2 follow the rules of formation for 
       user-defined names.  Mnemonic-name-1 can be used in ACCEPT, DISPLAY, 
       and WRITE statements.  Mnemonic-name-2 can be referenced only in the 
       SET statement.  Mnemonic-name-2 can qualify condition-1 or condition-2 
       names. 
<p>
       Mnemonic-names and environment-names need not be unique.  If you 
       choose a mnemonic-name that is also an environment-name, its 
       definition as a mnemonic-name will take precedence over its definition 
       as an environment-name.

       UPSI switches process special conditions within a program, such as 
       year-beginning or year-ending processing.  For example, at the

<p>
       <kbd>NATIVE</kbd> 
           Specifies the native character code set.  If the alphabet-name 
           clause is omitted, EBCDIC is assumed.

       <kbd>literal-1,</kbd> <kbd>literal-2,</kbd> <kbd>literal-3</kbd> 
           Specifies that the collating sequence is to be determined by the 
           program, according to the following rules: 
<p>
           o   The order in which literals appear specifies the ordinal 
               number, in ascending sequence, of the character(s) in this 
               collating sequence. 
<p>
           o   Each numeric literal specified must be an unsigned integer and 
               must have a value from 1 through 256.  The value of each 
               literal specifies the ordinal number <B>(beginning</B> <B>with</B> <B>1)</B> of a 
               character within the EBCDIC character set.  For example: 
<p>
                   The literal 92 represents the EBCDIC character $ (X'5B'). 
                   The literal 234 represents the EBCDIC character Z (X'E9').

               <A HREF=#A.1.2>Appendix B, &quot;EBCDIC and ASCII Collating Sequences&quot; in</A> 
               <A HREF=#A.1.2>topic APPENDIX1.2</A>, lists the ordinal number for characters in 
               the EBCDIC and ASCII collating sequences. 
<p>
           o   Each character in a nonnumeric literal represents that actual 
               character in the EBCDIC character set.  (If the nonnumeric 
               literal contains more than 1 character, each character, 
               starting with the leftmost, is assigned a successively 
               ascending position within this collating sequence.) 
<p>
           o   Any EBCDIC characters that are not explicitly specified assume 
               positions in this collating sequence higher than any of the 
               explicitly specified characters.  The relative order within 
               the set of these unspecified characters within the EBCDIC set 
               remains unchanged. 
<p>
           o   Within one alphabet-name clause, a given character must not be 
               specified more than once. 
<p>
           o   Each nonnumeric literal associated with a THROUGH or ALSO 
               phrase must be 1 character in length. 
<p>
           o   When the THROUGH phrase is specified, the contiguous 
               characters in the native character set beginning with the 
               character specified by literal-1 and ending with the character 
               specified by literal-2 are assigned successively ascending 
               positions in this collating sequence.  This sequence can be 
               either ascending or descending within the original native 
               character set.  That is, if &quot;Z&quot; THROUGH &quot;A&quot; is specified, the 
               ascending values, left-to-right, for the uppercase letters 
               are: 
<p>
                 <samp>ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA</samp> 
<p>
           o   When the ALSO phrase is specified, the EBCDIC characters 
               specified as literal-1, literal-3, etc., are assigned to the 
               same position in this collating sequence.  For example, if you 
               specify: 
<p>
                 <samp>&quot;D&quot;</samp> <samp>ALSO</samp> <samp>&quot;N&quot;</samp> <samp>ALSO</samp> <samp>&quot;%&quot;</samp> 
<p>
               the characters D, N, and % are all considered to be in the 
               same position in the collating sequence. 
<p>
           o   When the ALSO phrase is specified and alphabet-name-1 is 
               referenced in a SYMBOLIC CHARACTERS clause, only literal-1 is 
               used to represent the character in the EBCDIC set. 
<p>
           o   The character having the <B>highest</B> ordinal position in this 
               collating sequence is associated with the figurative constant 
               HIGH-VALUE.  If more than 1 character has the highest 
               position, because of specification of the ALSO phrase, the 
 |             last character specified (or defaulted to when any EBCDIC 
 |             characters are not explicitly specified) is considered to be 
               the HIGH-VALUE character for procedural statements such as 
 |             DISPLAY, or as the sending field in a MOVE statement.  (If all 
 |             EBCDIC characters and the ALSO phrase example given above were 
 |             specified as the high-order characters of this collating 
 |             sequence, the HIGH-VALUE character would be %.) 
<p>
           o   The character having the <B>lowest</B> ordinal position in this 
               collating sequence is associated with the figurative constant 
               LOW-VALUE.  If more than 1 character has the lowest position, 
               because of specification of the ALSO phrase, the first 
               character specified is the LOW-VALUE character.  (If the ALSO 
               phrase example given above were specified as the low-order 
               characters of the collating sequence, the LOW-VALUE character 
               would be D.) 
<p>
           When <B>literal-1</B>, <B>literal-2</B>, or <B>literal-3</B> is specified, the 
           alphabet-name must <B>not</B> be referred to in a CODE-SET clause (see 
           <A HREF=#2.6.11>&quot;CODE-SET Clause&quot; in topic 2.6.11</A>). 
<p>
           <B>Literal-1</B>, <B>literal-2</B>, and <B>literal-3</B> must not specify a 
           symbolic-character figurative constant. 
<p>
 x         Floating-point literals cannot be used in a user-specified 
 x         collating sequence.

       rules apply: 
<p>
       o   The relationship between each symbolic-character-1 and the 
           corresponding integer-1 is by their position in the SYMBOLIC

           with the second integer-1; and so forth. 
<p>
       o   There must be a one-to-one correspondence between occurrences of 
           symbolic-character-1 and occurrences of integer-1 in a SYMBOLIC 
           CHARACTERS clause. 
<p>
       o   If the IN phrase is specified, integer-1 specifies the ordinal 
           position of the character that is represented in the character set 
           named by alphabet-name-2.  This ordinal position must exist. 
<p>
       o   If the IN phrase is not specified, symbolic-character-1 represents

   The SELECT clause chooses a file. 
<p>
   <kbd>SELECT</kbd> <kbd>OPTIONAL</kbd> 
       Can be specified only for files opened in the input, I-O, or extend 
       mode.  You must specify SELECT OPTIONAL for such input files that are

       must contain at least 1 alphabetic character, and must be unique 
       within this program. 
<p>
   When file-name specifies a sort or a merge file, only the ASSIGN clause 
   can follow the SELECT clause. 
<p>
   If the file connector referenced by file-name-1 is an external file 
   connector, all file control entries in the run unit that reference this 
   file connector must have the same specification for the OPTIONAL phrase.

<p>
       Under VSE, <B>name</B> must be a 1- to 7-character field that specifies the 
       system name of the file.  It must be the same name specified in the 
       DLBL or TLBL statement for the file. 
<p>

   The ORGANIZATION clause identifies the logical structure of the file.  The 
   logical structure is established at the time the file is created and 
   cannot subsequently be changed. 
<p>
   You can find a discussion of the different ways in which data can be 
   organized and of the different access methods that you can use to retrieve 
   the data under <A HREF=#2.4.8.1>&quot;Data Organization and Access Modes&quot; in topic 2.4.8.1</A>. 
<p>
   <kbd>ORGANIZATION</kbd> <kbd>IS</kbd> <kbd>SEQUENTIAL</kbd> <kbd>(Format</kbd> <kbd>1)</kbd> 
       A predecessor-successor relationship among the records in the file is 
       established by the order in which records are placed in the file when 
       it is created or extended. 
<p>
   <kbd>ORGANIZATION</kbd> <kbd>IS</kbd> <kbd>INDEXED</kbd> <kbd>(Format</kbd> <kbd>2)</kbd> 
       The position of each logical record in the file is determined by 
 |     indexes created with the file and maintained by the system.  The 
 |     indexes are based on keys within the file's records. 
<p>
   <kbd>ORGANIZATION</kbd> <kbd>IS</kbd> <kbd>RELATIVE</kbd> <kbd>(Format</kbd> <kbd>3)</kbd> 
       The position of each logical record in the file is determined by its 
       relative record number. 
<p>
   If you omit the ORGANIZATION clause, the compiler assumes ORGANIZATION IS 
   SEQUENTIAL. 
<p>
   If the file connector referenced by file-name-1 in the SELECT clause is an 
   external file connector, all file control entries in the run unit that 
   reference this file connector must have the same organization.

   The PADDING CHARACTER clause specifies the character which is to be used 
   for block padding on sequential files. 
<p>
   <kbd>data-name-5</kbd> 
       Must be defined in the Data Division as an alphanumeric 1-character

<pre width="80">
<p>
   You establish the organization of the data when you create the file.  Once 
   the file has been created, you can expand the file, but you cannot change 
   the organization. 
<p>
<p>
   <I>QSAM,</I> <I>SAM,</I> <I>and</I> <I>VSAM</I> <I>Sequential</I> <I>Organization</I>:  The physical order in which 
   the records are placed in the file determines the sequence of records. 
   The relationships among records in the file do not change, except that the 
   file can be extended.  Records can be fixed-length or variable-length; 
   there are no keys. 
<p>
   Each record in the file, except the first, has a unique predecessor 
   record, and each record, except the last, also has a unique successor 
   record. 
<p>
<p>
 | <I>VSAM</I> <I>Indexed</I> <I>Organization</I>:  Each record in the file has one or more keys 
 | (referred to as key data items); each key is associated with an index.  An 
   index provides a logical path to the data records, according to the 
   contents of the associated embedded record key data items.  Indexed files 
   must be direct-access storage files.  Records can be fixed-length or 
   variable-length. 
<p>
   Each record in an indexed file must have an embedded prime key data item. 
   When records are inserted, updated, or deleted, they are identified solely 
   by the values of their prime keys.  Thus, the value in each prime key data 
   item must be unique and must not be changed when the record is updated. 
   You tell COBOL the name of the prime key data item on the RECORD KEY 
   clause of the FILE-CONTROL paragraph. 
<p>
   In addition, each record in an indexed file can contain one or more 
   embedded alternate key data items.  Each alternate key provides another 
   means of identifying which record to retrieve.  The programmer can specify 
   with VSAM options that the values contained in an alternate key data item 
   need not be unique.  You tell COBOL the name of any alternate key data 
   items on the ALTERNATE RECORD KEY clause of the FILE-CONTROL paragraph. 
<p>
   The key used for any specific input-output request is known as the <B>key</B> <B>of</B> 
   <B>reference</B>. 
<p>
<p>
   <I>VSAM</I> <I>Relative</I> <I>Organization</I>:  Think of the file as a string of record 
   areas, each of which contains a single record.  Each record area is 
   identified by a relative record number; the access method stores and 
   retrieves a record, based on its relative record number.  For example, the 
   first record area is addressed by relative record number 1, and the 10th 
   is addressed by relative record number 10.  The physical sequence in which 
   the records were placed in the file has no bearing on the record area in 
   which they are stored, and thus on each record's relative record number. 
   Relative files must be direct-access files.  Records can be fixed-length 
   or variable-length.

   <I>Sequential-Access</I> <I>Mode</I>:  Allows reading and writing records of a file in a

   position of a record in the file. 
<p>
<p>
   <I>Random-Access</I> <I>Mode</I>:  Allows reading and writing records in a 
   programmer-specified manner; the control of successive references to the 
   file is expressed by specifically defined keys supplied by the user. 
<p>
<p>
   <I>Dynamic-Access</I> <I>Mode</I>:  Allows the specific input-output statement to 
   determine the access mode.  Therefore, records can be processed 
   sequentially and/or randomly. 
<p>
   For EXTERNAL files, every file control entry in the run unit that is 
   associated with that external file must specify the same access mode.  In 
   addition, for VSAM relative file entries, data-name-4 must reference an

<pre width="80">
<p>
   The I-O-CONTROL paragraph of the INPUT-OUTPUT SECTION specifies when 
   checkpoints are to be taken and the storage areas to be shared by 
   different files.  This paragraph is optional in a COBOL program. 
<p>
   The keyword I-O-CONTROL can appear only once, at the beginning of the 
   paragraph.  The word I-O-CONTROL must begin in Area A, and must be 
   followed by a separator period. 
<p>
   Each clause within the paragraph can be separated from the next by a 
   separator comma or a separator semicolon.  The order in which I-O-CONTROL 
   paragraph clauses are written is not significant.  The I-O-CONTROL 
   paragraph ends with a separator period.

   The RERUN clause specifies that checkpoint records are to be taken.

<p>
   The RERUN clause cannot be used with files that have been defined with the

       The external data set for the checkpoint file.  It must not be the

<p>

<pre width="80">
<p>
   File data is contained in files.  (See <A HREF=#2.6.1>&quot;File Section&quot; in topic 2.6.1</A>.)  A 
   <B>file</B> is a collection of data records existing on some input-output device. 
   A file can be considered as a group of physical records; it can also be 
   considered as a group of logical records.  The Data Division describes the 
   relationship between physical and logical records. 
<p>
   A <B>physical</B> <B>record</B> is a unit of data that is treated as an entity when 
   moved into or out of storage.  The size of a physical record is determined 
   by the particular input-output device on which it is stored.  The size 
   does not necessarily have a direct relationship to the size or content of 
   the logical information contained in the file. 
<p>
   A <B>logical</B> <B>record</B> is a unit of data whose subdivisions have a logical 
   relationship.  A logical record may itself be a physical record (that is, 
   be contained completely within one physical unit of data); several logical 
   records may be contained within one physical record, or one logical record 
   may extend across several physical records. 
<p>
   <B>File</B> <B>description</B> <B>entries</B> specify the physical aspects of the data (such as 
   the size relationship between physical and logical records, the size and 
   name(s) of the logical record(s), labeling information, and so forth). 
<p>
   <B>Record</B> <B>description</B> <B>entries</B> describe the logical records in the file, 
   including the category and format of data within each field of the logical 
   record, different values the data might be assigned, and so forth. 
<p>
   After the relationship between physical and logical records has been 
   established, only logical records are made available to you.  For this 
   reason, a reference in this manual to &quot;records&quot; means logical records, 
   unless the term &quot;physical records&quot; is used.

<p>
   Program data is created by a program, instead of being read from a file. 
<p>
   The concept of logical records applies to program data as well as to file 
   data.  Program data can thus be grouped into logical records, and be 
   defined by a series of record description entries.  Items that need not be 
   so grouped can be defined in independent data description entries (called 
   <B>data</B> <B>item</B> <B>description</B> <B>entries</B>).

<p>
   The relationships among all data to be used in a program are defined in 
   the Data Division, through a system of level indicators and level-numbers. 
<p>
   A <B>level</B> <B>indicator</B>, with its descriptive entry, identifies each file in a 
   program.  Level indicators represent the highest level of any data 
   hierarchy with which they are associated; FD is the file description level 
   indicator and SD is the sort-merge file description level indicator. 
<p>
   A <B>level-number</B>, with its descriptive entry, indicates the properties of 
   specific data.  Level-numbers can be used to describe a data hierarchy; 
   they can indicate that this data has a special purpose, and while they can 
   be associated with (and subordinate to) level indicators, they can also be 
   used independently to describe internal data or data common to two or more 
   programs.  (See <A HREF=#2.7.1>&quot;Level-Numbers&quot; in topic 2.7.1</A> for level-number rules.)

   After a record has been defined, it can be subdivided to provide more 
   detailed data references. 
<p>
   For example, in a customer file for a department store, one complete 
   record could contain all data pertaining to one customer.  Subdivisions 
   within that record could be:  customer name, customer address, account 
   number, department number of sale, unit amount of sale, dollar amount of 
   sale, previous balance, plus other pertinent information. 
<p>
   The basic subdivisions of a record (that is, those fields not further 
   subdivided) are called <B>elementary</B> <B>items</B>.  Thus, a record can be made up of 
   a series of elementary items, or it can itself be an elementary item. 
<p>
   It may be necessary to refer to a set of elementary items; thus, 
   elementary items can be combined into <B>group</B> <B>items</B>.  Groups themselves can 
   be combined into a more inclusive group that contains one or more 
   subgroups.  Thus, within one hierarchy of data items, an elementary item 
   can belong to more than one group item. 
<p>
   A system of level-numbers specifies the organization of elementary and 
   group items into records.  Special level-numbers are also used; they 
   identify data items used for special purposes.

<pre width="80">
<p>
   Each group and elementary item in a record requires a separate entry, and 
   each must be assigned a level-number. 
<p>
   A level-number is a 1- or 2-digit integer between 01 and 49, or one of 
   three special level-numbers: 66, 77, or 88.  The following level-numbers 
   are used to structure records: 
<p>
   01 
       This level-number specifies the record itself, and is the most 
       inclusive level-number possible.  A level-01 entry can be either a 
       group item or an elementary item.  It must begin in Area A. 
<p>
   02-49 
       These level-numbers specify group and elementary items within a 
       record.  They can begin in Area A or Area B.  Less inclusive data 
       items are assigned higher (not necessarily consecutive) level-numbers 
       in this series. 
<p>
   A group item includes all group and elementary items following it, until a 
   level-number less than or equal to the level-number of this group is 
   encountered. 
<p>
   All elementary or group items immediately subordinate to one group item 
   must be assigned identical level-numbers higher than the level-number of 
   this group item. 
<p>
   Figure 3 illustrates the concept.  Note that all groups immediately 
   subordinate to the level-01 entry have the same level-number.  Note also 
   that elementary items from different subgroups do not necessarily have the 
   same level numbers, and that elementary items can be specified at any 
   level within the hierarchy.

<A NAME=2.5.3.6><H3> 2.5.3.6   Alignment Rules</H3></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   The standard alignment rules for positioning data in an elementary item 
   depend on the category of a receiving item (that is, an item into which 
   the data is moved; see <A HREF=#3.22.1>&quot;Elementary Moves&quot; in topic 3.22.1</A>). 
<p>
<p>
   <I>Numeric</I>:  For such receiving items, the following rules apply: 
<p>
   1.  The data is aligned on the assumed decimal point and, if necessary, 
       truncated or padded with zeros.  (An <B>assumed</B> <B>decimal</B> <B>point</B> is one that 
       has logical meaning but that does not exist as an actual character in 
       the data.) 
<p>
   2.  If an assumed decimal point is not explicitly specified, the receiving 
       item is treated as though an assumed decimal point is specified 
       immediately to the right of the field.  The data is then treated 
       according to the preceding rule. 
<p>
<p>
   <I>Numeric-edited</I>:  The data is aligned on the decimal point, and (if 
   necessary) truncated or padded with zeros at either end, except when 
   editing causes replacement of leading zeros. 
<p>
<p>
 x <I>Internal</I> <I>Floating-point</I>:  A decimal point is assumed immediately to the 
 x left of the field.  The data is aligned then on the leftmost digit 
 x position following the decimal point, with the exponent adjusted 
 x accordingly. 
<p>
<p>
 x <I>External</I> <I>Floating-point</I>:  The data is aligned on the leftmost digit 
 x position; the exponent is adjusted accordingly. 
<p>
<p>
 x <I>Alphanumeric,</I> <I>Alphanumeric-Edited,</I> <I>Alphabetic,</I> <I>DBCS</I>:  For these receiving 
   items, the following rules apply: 
<p>
   1.  The data is aligned at the leftmost character position, and (if 
       necessary) truncated or padded with spaces at the right. 
<p>
   2.  If the JUSTIFIED clause is specified for this receiving item, the 
       above rule is modified, as described in <A HREF=#2.7.5>&quot;JUSTIFIED Clause&quot; in</A> 
       <A HREF=#2.7.5>topic 2.7.5</A>.

<A NAME=2.5.3.7><H3> 2.5.3.7   Standard Data Format</H3></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   COBOL makes data description as machine independent as possible.  For this 
   reason, the properties of the data are described in relation to a standard 
   data format rather than a machine-oriented format. 
<p>
   The standard data format uses the decimal system to represent numbers, no 
   matter what base is used by the system, and uses all the characters of the 
   character set of the computer to represent nonnumeric data.

<A NAME=2.5.3.8><H3> 2.5.3.8   Character-String and Item Size</H3></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   In your program, the size of an elementary item is determined through the 
   number of character positions specified in its PICTURE character-string. 
   In storage, however, the size is determined by the actual number of bytes 
   the item occupies, as determined by the combination of its PICTURE 
   character-string and its USAGE clause. 
<p>
 x For internal floating-point items, the size of the item in storage is 
 x determined by its USAGE clause.  USAGE COMPUTATIONAL-1 reserves 4 bytes of 
 x storage for the item; USAGE COMPUTATIONAL-2 reserves 8 bytes of storage. 
<p>
   Normally, when an arithmetic item is moved from a longer field into a 
   shorter one, the compiler truncates the data to the number of characters 
   represented in the shorter item's PICTURE character-string. 
<p>
   For example, if a sending field with PICTURE S99999, and containing the 
   value +12345, is moved to a BINARY receiving field with PICTURE S99, the 
   data is truncated to +45.  For additional information see <A HREF=#2.7.12>&quot;USAGE Clause&quot;</A> 
   <A HREF=#2.7.12>in topic 2.7.12</A>. 
<p>
 x The TRUNC compiler option may affect the value of a binary numeric item. 
 x For information on TRUNC, see <cite>VS</cite> <cite>COBOL</cite> <cite>II</cite> <cite>Application</cite> <cite>Programming</cite> <cite>Guide</cite>

   operational signs and editing signs.

<A NAME=2.5.3.10><H3> 2.5.3.10   Operational Signs</H3></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   Operational signs are associated with signed numeric items, and indicate 
   their algebraic properties.  The internal representation of an algebraic 
   sign depends on the item's USAGE clause, its SIGN clause (if present), and 
   on the operating environment involved.  (For further details about the 
   internal representation see <A HREF=#2.7.12>&quot;USAGE Clause&quot; in topic 2.7.12</A>.)  Zero is 
   considered a unique value, regardless of the operational sign.  An 
   unsigned field is always assumed to be either positive or zero.

       that specified in the associated SELECT clause.  The file-name must 
       adhere to the rules of formation for a user-defined word; at least 1 
       character must be alphabetic.  The file-name must be unique within 
       this program.

<A NAME=2.6.2><H2> 2.6.2   EXTERNAL Clause</H2></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   The EXTERNAL clause specifies that a file connector is external, and 
   permits communication between two programs by the sharing of files.  A 
   file connector is external if the storage associated with that file is 
   associated with the run unit rather than with any particular program 
   within the run unit.  An external file can be referenced by any program in 
   the run unit that describes the file.  References to an external file from 
   different programs using separate descriptions of the file are always to 
   the same file.  In a run unit, there is only one representative of an 
   external file. 
<p>
   In the File Section, the EXTERNAL clause can be specified only in file 
   description entries. 
<p>
   The records appearing in the file description entry need not have the same 
   name in corresponding external file description entries.  In addition, the 
   number of such records need not be the same in corresponding file 
   description entries. 
<p>
   Use of the EXTERNAL clause does not imply that the associated file-name is 
   a global name.  For specific information on the use of the EXTERNAL 
   clause, see <cite>VS</cite> <cite>COBOL</cite> <cite>II</cite> <cite>Application</cite> <cite>Programming</cite> <cite>Guide</cite> <cite>for</cite> <cite>MVS</cite> <cite>and</cite> <cite>CMS</cite> or

<A NAME=2.6.3><H2> 2.6.3   GLOBAL Clause</H2></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   The GLOBAL clause specifies that the file connector named by a file-name 
   is a global name.  A global file-name is available to the program that 
   declares it and to every program that is contained directly or indirectly 
   in that program. 
<p>
   A file-name is global if the GLOBAL clause is specified in the file 
   description entry for that file-name.  A record-name is global if the 
   GLOBAL clause is specified in the record description entry by which the 
   record-name is declared or, in the case of record description entries in 
   the File Section, if the GLOBAL clause is specified in the file 
   description entry for the file-name associated with the record description

<A NAME=2.6.4><H2> 2.6.4   BLOCK CONTAINS Clause</H2></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   The BLOCK CONTAINS clause specifies the size of the physical records. 
<p>
   If the records in the file are not blocked, the BLOCK CONTAINS clause can 
   be omitted. 
<p>
   When it is omitted, the compiler assumes that records are not blocked. 
   Even if each physical record contains only one complete logical record, 
   coding BLOCK CONTAINS 1 RECORD would result in fixed blocked records. 
<p>
   The BLOCK CONTAINS clause can be omitted when the associated File Control 
   entry specifies a VSAM file; the concept of blocking has no meaning for 
 | VSAM files; the clause is syntax-checked but is treated as documentation. 
<p>
   For EXTERNAL files, the value of all BLOCK CONTAINS clauses of 
 | corresponding EXTERNAL files must match within the run unit.  This 
 | conformance is in terms of character positions and does not depend upon 
 | whether the value was specified as CHARACTERS or as RECORDS. 
<p>
   <kbd>integer-1,</kbd> <kbd>integer-2</kbd> 
       Must be nonzero unsigned integers.  They specify the number of: 
<p>
       <kbd>CHARACTERS</kbd> 
           Specifies the number of character positions required to store the 
           physical record, no matter what USAGE the characters have within 
           the data record. 
<p>
           If only integer-2 is specified, it specifies the exact character 
           size of the physical record.  When integer-1 and integer-2 are 
           both specified, they represent, respectively, the minimum and 
           maximum character sizes of the physical record. 
<p>
           Integer-1 and integer-2 must include any control bytes and padding 
           contained in the physical record.  (Logical records do not include 
           padding.) 
<p>
           The CHARACTERS phrase is the default.  CHARACTERS must be 
           specified when: 
<p>
           o   The physical record contains padding. 
<p>
           o   Logical records are grouped so that an inaccurate physical 
               record size could be implied.  For example, suppose you 
               describe a variable-length record of 100 characters, yet each 
               time you write a block of 4, one 50-character record is 
               written followed by three 100-character records.  If the 
               RECORDS phrase were specified, the compiler would calculate 
               the block size as 420 characters instead of the actual size, 
               370 characters.  (This calculation includes block and record 
               descriptors.) 
<p>
       <kbd>RECORDS</kbd> 
           Specifies the number of logical records contained in each physical 
           record. 
<p>
           The compiler assumes that the block size must provide for 
           integer-2 records of maximum size, and provides any additional 
           space needed for control bytes.

   <kbd>integer-6</kbd> 
       Specifies the minimum number of character positions to be contained in 
       any record of the file.  If integer-6 is not specified, the minimum 
       number of character positions to be contained in any record of the 
       file is equal to the least number of character positions described for 
       a record in that file. 
<p>
   <kbd>integer-7</kbd> 
       Specifies the maximum number of character positions in any record of 
       the file.  If integer-7 is not specified, the maximum number of 
       character positions to be contained in any record of the file is equal 
       to the greatest number of character positions described for a record 
       in that file. 
<p>
   The number of character positions associated with a record description is 
   determined by the sum of the number of character positions in all 
   elementary data items (excluding redefinitions and renamings), plus any 
   implicit FILLER due to synchronization.  If a table is specified: 
<p>
   o   The minimum number of table elements described in the record is used 
       in the summation above to determine the minimum number of character 
       positions associated with the record description. 
<p>
   o   The maximum number of table elements described in the record is used 
       in the summation above to determine the maximum number of character 
       positions associated with the record description. 
<p>
   If data-name-1 is specified: 
<p>
   o   Data-name-1 must be an elementary unsigned integer. 
<p>
   o   The number of character positions in the record must be placed into 
       the data item referenced by data-name-1 before any RELEASE, REWRITE, 
       or WRITE statement is executed for the file. 
<p>
   o   The execution of a DELETE, RELEASE, REWRITE, START, or WRITE statement 
       or the unsuccessful execution of a READ or RETURN statement does not 
       alter the content of the data item referenced by data-name-1. 
<p>
   o   After the successful execution of a READ or RETURN statement for the 
       file, the contents of the data item referenced by data-name-1 indicate 
       the number of character positions in the record just read. 
<p>
   During the execution of a RELEASE, REWRITE, or WRITE statement, the number 
   of character positions in the record is determined by the following 
   conditions: 
<p>
   o   If data-name-1 is specified, by the content of the data item 
       referenced by data-name-1. 
<p>
   o   If data-name-1 is not specified and the record does not contain a 
       variable occurrence data item, by the number of character positions in 
       the record. 
<p>
   o   If data-name-1 is not specified and the record contains a variable 
       occurrence data item, by the sum of the fixed position and that 
       portion of the table described by the number of occurrences at the 
       time of execution of the output statement. 
<p>
   During the execution of a READ ... INTO or RETURN ... INTO statement, the 
   number of character positions in the current record that participate as 
   the sending data items in the implicit MOVE statement is determined by the 
   following conditions: 
<p>
   o   If data-name-1 is specified, by the content of the data item 
       referenced by data-name-1. 
<p>
   o   If data-name-1 is not specified, by the value that would have been 
       moved into the data item referenced by data-name-1 had data-name-1 
       been specified.

   <I>For</I> <I>all</I> <I>3</I> <I>Formats</I>:  When the RECORD clause is used, the record size must 
   be specified as the number of character positions needed to store the 
   record internally.  That is, it must specify the number of bytes occupied 
   internally by the characters of the record (not the number of characters 
   used to represent the item within the record).  The size of a record is 
   determined according to the rules for obtaining the size of a group item. 
   (See <A HREF=#2.7.12>&quot;USAGE Clause&quot; in topic 2.7.12</A> and <A HREF=#2.7.11>&quot;SYNCHRONIZED Clause&quot; in</A> 
   <A HREF=#2.7.11>topic 2.7.11</A>.) 
<p>
   When the RECORD clause is omitted, the compiler determines the record 
   lengths from the record descriptions.  When one of the entries within a 
   record description contains an OCCURS DEPENDING ON clause, the compiler 
   uses the maximum value of the variable-length item to calculate the number 
   of character positions needed to store the record internally. 
<p>
   If the associated file connector is an external file connector, all file 
   description entries in the run unit that are associated with that file 
   connector must specify the same maximum number of character positions.

   Figure 4. LINAGE Clause Phrases 
<p>
   The logical page size specified in the LINAGE clause is the sum of all 
   values specified in each phrase except the FOOTING phrase.  If the LINES 
   AT TOP and/or the LINES AT BOTTOM phrase is omitted, the assumed value for 
   top and bottom margins is zero.  Each logical page immediately follows the 
   preceding logical page, with no additional spacing provided. 
<p>
   If the FOOTING phrase is omitted, its assumed value is equal to that of 
   the page body (integer-8 or data-name-5). 
<p>
   At the time an OPEN OUTPUT statement is executed, the values of integer-8, 
   integer-9, integer-10, and integer-11, if specified, are used to determine 
   the page body, first footing line, top margin, and bottom margin of the 
   logical page for this file.  See Figure 4 above.  These values are then 
   used for all logical pages printed for this file during a given execution 
   of the program. 
<p>
   At the time an OPEN statement with the OUTPUT phrase is executed for the 
   file, data-name-5, data-name-6, data-name-7, and data-name-8 determine the 
   page body, first footing line, top margin, and bottom margin for the first 
   logical page only. 
<p>
   At the time a WRITE statement with the ADVANCING PAGE phrase is executed 
   or a page overflow condition occurs, the values of data-name-5, 
   data-name-6, data-name-7, and data-name-8 if specified, are used to 
   determine the page body, first footing line, top margin, and bottom margin 
   for the next logical page. 
<p>
   If an external file connector is associated with this file description 
   entry, all file description entries in the run unit that are associated 
   with this file connector must have: 
<p>
   o   A LINAGE clause, if any file description entry has a LINAGE clause. 
<p>
   o   The same corresponding values for integer-8, integer-9, integer-10, 
       and integer-11, if specified. 
<p>
   o   The same corresponding external data items referenced by data-name-5, 
       data-name-6, data-name-7, and data-name-8. 
<p>

   control characters in EXTERNAL files.

</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
 x The RECORDING MODE clause specifies the format of the physical records in 
 x a QSAM or SAM file.  The clause is ignored for a VSAM file. 
<p>
 x Permitted values for RECORDING MODE are: 
<p>
 x <kbd>Recording</kbd> <kbd>Mode</kbd> <kbd>F</kbd> <kbd>(Fixed)</kbd> 
 x     All the records in a file are the same length and each is wholly 
 x     contained within one block.  Blocks may contain more than one record, 
 x     and there is usually a fixed number of records for each block.  In 
 x     this mode, there are no record-length or block-descriptor fields. 
<p>
 x <kbd>Recording</kbd> <kbd>Mode</kbd> <kbd>V</kbd> <kbd>(Variable)</kbd> 
 x     The records can be either fixed-length or variable-length, and each 
 x     must be wholly contained within one block.  Blocks can contain more 
 x     than one record.  Each data record includes a record-length field and 
 x     each block includes a block-descriptor field.  These fields are not 
 x     described in the Data Division.  They are each 4 bytes long and 
 x     provision is automatically made for them.  These fields are not 
 x     available to you. 
<p>
 x <kbd>Recording</kbd> <kbd>Mode</kbd> <kbd>U</kbd> <kbd>(Fixed</kbd> <kbd>or</kbd> <kbd>Variable)</kbd> 
 x     The records can be either fixed-length or variable-length.  However, 
 x     there is only one record for each block.  There are no record-length 
 x     or block-descriptor fields. 
<p>
 x     When recording mode U is used, the BLOCK CONTAINS clause must <B>not</B> be 
 x     used. 
<p>
 x <kbd>Recording</kbd> <kbd>Mode</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd> <kbd>(Spanned)</kbd> 
 x     The records can be either fixed-length or variable-length, and can be 
 x     larger than a block.  If a record is larger than the remaining space 
 x     in a block, a segment of the record is written to fill the block.  The 
 x     remainder of the record is stored in the next block (or blocks, if 
 x     required).  Only complete records are made available to you.  Each 
 x     segment of a record in a block, even if it is the entire record, 
 x     includes a segment-descriptor field, and each block includes a 
 x     block-descriptor field.  These fields are not described in the Data 
 x     Division; provision is automatically made for them.  These fields are 
 x     not available to you. 
<p>
 x     When recording mode S is used, the BLOCK CONTAINS CHARACTERS clause 
 x     <B>must</B> be used.  Recording mode S is not allowed for ASCII files. 
<p>
<p>
 x If the RECORDING MODE clause is not specified for a QSAM or SAM file, the 
 x VS COBOL II compiler determines the recording mode as follows: 
<p>
 x <B>F</B>   The compiler determines the recording mode to be F if the largest 
 x     level-01 record associated with the file is not greater than the block 
 x     size specified in the BLOCK CONTAINS clause, and you do one of the 
 x     following: 
<p>
 x     o   Use the RECORD CONTAINS <cite>integer</cite> clause (for more information, see 
 x         <cite>VS</cite> <cite>COBOL</cite> <cite>II</cite> <cite>Migration</cite> <cite>Guide</cite> <cite>for</cite> <cite>MVS</cite> <cite>and</cite> <cite>CMS</cite> or <cite>VS</cite> <cite>COBOL</cite> <cite>II</cite> 
 x         <cite>Migration</cite> <cite>Guide</cite> <cite>for</cite> <cite>VSE).</cite> 
<p>
 x     o   Omit the RECORD clause and make sure all level-01 records 
 x         associated with the file are the same size and none contain an 
 x         OCCURS DEPENDING ON clause. 
<p>
 x <B>V</B>   The compiler determines the recording mode to be V if the largest 
 x     level-01 record associated with the file is not greater than the block 
 x     size specified in the BLOCK CONTAINS clause, and you do one of the 
 x     following: 
<p>
 x     o   Use the RECORD IS VARYING clause 
<p>
 x     o   Omit the RECORD clause and make sure all level-01 records 
 x         associated with the file are not the same size or some contain an 
 x         OCCURS DEPENDING ON clause 
<p>
 x     o   Use the RECORD CONTAINS <cite>integer-1</cite> TO <cite>integer-2</cite> clause with 
 x         integer-1 the minimum length and integer-2 the maximum length of 
 x         the level-01 records associated with the file.  The two integers 
 x         must be different, with values matching minimum and maximum length 
 x         of either different length records or record(s) with an OCCURS 
 x         DEPENDING ON clause. 
<p>
 x <B>S</B>   The compiler determines the recording mode to be S if the maximum

   character set. 
<p>
   When the CODE-SET clause is specified for a file, all data in this file

   The level-number specifies the hierarchy of data within a record, and 
   identifies special-purpose data entries.  A level-number begins a data 
   description entry, a renamed or redefined item, or a condition-name entry. 
   A level-number has a value taken from the set of integers between 1 and 
   49, or from one of the special level-numbers, 66, 77, or 88.

<A NAME=2.7.3><H2> 2.7.3   EXTERNAL Clause</H2></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   The EXTERNAL clause specifies that the storage associated with a data item 
   is associated with the run unit rather than with any particular program 
   within the run unit.  An external data item can be referenced by any 
   program in the run unit that describes the data item.  References to an 
   external data item from different programs using separate descriptions of 
   the data item are always to the same data item.  In a run unit, there is 
   only one representative of an external data item. 
<p>
   The EXTERNAL clause can be specified only in data description entries in 
   the Working-Storage Section whose level-number is 01.  It cannot be 
   specified in the Linkage Section or File Section.  Any data item described 
   by a data description entry subordinate to an entry describing an external 
   record also attains the EXTERNAL attribute.  Indexes in an external data 
   record do not possess the external attribute. 
<p>
   The data contained in the record named by the data-name clause is external 
   and can be accessed and processed by any program in the run unit that 
   describes and, optionally, redefines it.  This data is subject to the 
   following rules: 
<p>
   o   If two or more programs within a run unit describe the same external 
       data record, each record-name of the associated record description 
       entries must be the same and the records must define the same number 
       of standard data format characters.  However, a program that describes 
       an external record can contain a data description entry including the 
       REDEFINES clause that redefines the complete external record, and this 
       complete redefinition need not occur identically in other programs in 
       the run unit. 
<p>
   o   Use of the EXTERNAL clause does not imply that the associated 
       data-name is a global name.

<A NAME=2.7.4><H2> 2.7.4   GLOBAL Clause</H2></A>

<pre width="80">
<p>
   The GLOBAL clause specifies that a data-name is available to every program 
   contained within the program that declares it, as long as the contained 
   program does not itself have a declaration for that name.  All data-names 
   subordinate to or condition-names or indexes associated with a global name 
   are global names. 
<p>
   A data-name is global if the GLOBAL clause is specified either in the data 
   description entry by which the data-name is declared or in another entry 
 | to which that data description entry is subordinate.  The GLOBAL clause 
 | can be specified in the Working-Storage and File Sections, but only in

 | in the Linkage Section. 
<p>
   In the same Data Division, the data description entries for any two data 
   items for which the same data-name is specified must not include the

   The JUSTIFIED clause can be specified only at the elementary level.  JUST 
   is an abbreviation for JUSTIFIED, and has the same meaning. 
<p>
   The JUSTIFIED clause cannot be specified for numeric, numeric-edited, or

 x permitted for an edited DBCS item.  When JUSTIFIED is specified for a 
 x receiving item, the data is aligned on the rightmost character position. 
 x If the sending item is larger than the receiving item, extra characters 
 x are truncated on the left.  If the sending item is smaller than the

   Formats for the OCCURS clause are:

<p>
 | The <B>subject</B> of an OCCURS clause is the data-name of the data item 
 | containing the OCCURS clause.  Except for the OCCURS clause itself, data 
 | description clauses used with the subject apply to each occurrence of the

<p>
 | The ASCENDING/DESCENDING KEY phrase specifies the order in which the data 
 | in the table will be arranged.  Data is arranged in ascending or 
   descending order (depending on the keyword specified) according to the 
   values contained in data-name-2.  The data-names are listed in their 
   descending order of significance. 
<p>
   The order is determined by the rules for comparison of operands (see 
   <A HREF=#2.8.5.4>&quot;Relation Condition&quot; in topic 2.8.5.4</A>).  The ASCENDING and DESCENDING KEY 
 | data items are used in OCCURS clauses and the SEARCH ALL statement for a 
 | search of the table element. 
<p>
   <kbd>data-name-2</kbd> 
       Must be the name of the subject entry, or the name of an entry 
       subordinate to the subject entry.  It can be qualified. 
<p>
       If data-name-2 names the subject entry, that entire entry becomes the 
       ASCENDING/DESCENDING KEY, and is the only key that can be specified 
       for this table element. 
<p>
       If data-name-2 does not name the subject entry, then data-name-2: 
<p>
       o   Must be subordinate to the subject of the table entry itself 
       o   Must <B>not</B> be subordinate to, or follow, any other entry that 
           contains an OCCURS clause 
       o   Must not contain an OCCURS clause. 
<p>
 |     Data-name-2 must not have subordinate items that contain OCCURS 
 |     DEPENDING ON clauses. 
<p>
   When the ASCENDING/DESCENDING KEY phrase is specified, the following rules 
   apply: 
<p>
   o   Keys must be listed in decreasing order of significance. 
<p>
   o   The total number of keys for a given table element must not exceed 12. 
<p>
 | o   You must ensure that the data actually present in the table is 
 |     arranged in ASCENDING or DESCENDING sequence according to the 
 |     collating sequence in use. 
<p>
   o   A key can have DISPLAY, BINARY, PACKED-DECIMAL, or COMPUTATIONAL 
       usage. 
<p>
   o   The sum of the lengths of all the keys associated with one table 
       element must not exceed 255. 
<p>
 x o   A key can have COMPUTATIONAL-1, COMPUTATIONAL-2, COMPUTATIONAL-3, or 
 x     COMPUTATIONAL-4 usage. 
<p>
 x o   The ASCENDING/DESCENDING KEY phrase (for a SEARCH ALL statement only) 
 x     can be specified in the OCCURS clause for a DBCS item. 
<p>
 x o   If a key is specified without qualifiers and it is not a unique name, 
 x     the key will be implicitly qualified with the subject of the OCCURS 
 x     clause and all qualifiers of the OCCURS clause subject. 
<p>
   The following example illustrates the specification of ASCENDING KEY data 
   item:

<p>
   The keys for EMPLOYEE-TABLE are subordinate to that entry, while the key 
   for WEEK-RECORD is subordinate to that subordinate entry. 
<p>
   In the preceding example, records in EMPLOYEE-TABLE must be arranged in 
   ascending order of WAGE-RATE, and in ascending order of EMPLOYEE-NO within 
   WAGE-RATE.  Records in WEEK-RECORD must be arranged in ascending order of 
   WEEK-NO.  If they are not, results of any SEARCH ALL statement will be 
   unpredictable.

<p>
   The INDEXED BY phrase specifies the indexes that can be used with this 
   table.  The INDEXED BY phrase is required if indexing is used to refer to 
   this table element.  See <A HREF=#1.5.1.4.2>&quot;Subscripting Using Index-Names (Indexing)&quot; in</A> 
   <A HREF=#1.5.1.4.2>topic 1.5.1.4.2</A>.

   <B>Note:</B>  Indexes specified in an External data record do not possess the 
   external attribute. 
<p>
   <kbd>index-name-1</kbd> 
       Must follow the rules for formation of user-defined words.  At least 
       one character must be alphabetic. 
<p>
       Each index-name specifies an index to be created by the compiler for 
       use by the program.  These index-names are <B>not</B> data-names, and are not 
       identified elsewhere in the COBOL program; instead, they can be 
       regarded as private special registers for the use of this object 
       program only.  As such, they are not data, or part of any data 
       hierarchy; as such, each must be unique. 
<p>
       In one table entry, up to 12 index-names can be specified. 
<p>
       If a data item possessing the GLOBAL attribute includes a table 
       accessed with an index, that index also possesses the GLOBAL 
       attribute.  Therefore, the scope of an index-name is identical to that 
       of the data-name which names the table whose index is named by that 
       index-name and the scope of name rules for data-names apply.

   The OCCURS DEPENDING ON clause specifies variable-length tables. 
<p>
   <kbd>data-name-1</kbd> 
       Specifies the <B>object</B> of the OCCURS DEPENDING ON clause; that is, the 
       data item whose current value represents the current number of 
       occurrences of the subject item.  The contents of items whose 
       occurrence numbers exceed the value of the object are undefined. 
<p>
 |     Must describe an integer item. 
<p>
       The object of the OCCURS DEPENDING ON clause must not occupy any 
       storage position within the range of the table (that is, any storage 
       position from the first character position in the table through the 
       last character position in the table). 
<p>
 x     The object of the OCCURS DEPENDING ON clause cannot be variably 
 x     located; the object cannot follow an item that contains an OCCURS 
 x     DEPENDING ON clause. 
<p>
       If the OCCURS clause is specified in a data description entry included 
       in a record description entry containing the EXTERNAL clause, 
       data-name-1, if specified, must reference a data item possessing the 
       external attribute which is described in the same Data Division. 
<p>
       If the OCCURS clause is specified in a data description entry 
       subordinate to one containing the GLOBAL clause, data-name-1, if 
       specified, must be a global name and must reference a data item which 
       is described in the same Data Division. 
<p>
   At the time that the group item, or any data item that contains a 
 x subordinate OCCURS DEPENDING ON item or that follows but is not 
 x subordinate to the OCCURS DEPENDING ON item, is referenced, the value of 
   the object of the OCCURS DEPENDING ON clause must fall within the range 
   integer-1 through integer-2. 
<p>
 x <B>Note:</B>  This element may exhibit different behavior when the CMPR2 compiler 
 x option is in effect.  For more information, see <cite>VS</cite> <cite>COBOL</cite> <cite>II</cite> <cite>Migration</cite>

<p>
   When a group item containing a subordinate OCCURS DEPENDING ON item is 
   referred to, the part of the table area used in the operation is 
   determined as follows: 
<p>
   o   If the object is outside the group, only that part of the table area 
       that is specified by the object at the start of the operation will be 
       used. 
<p>
   o   If the object is included in the same group and the group data item is 
       referenced as a sending item, only that part of the table area that is 
       specified by the value of the object at the start of the operation 
       will be used in the operation. 
<p>
   o   If the object is included in the same group and the group data item is 
       referenced as a receiving item, the maximum length of the group item 
       will be used in the operation. 
<p>
   The following verbs are affected by the maximum length rule: 
<p>
   o   ACCEPT identifier (Format 1 and 2) 
 | o   CALL ... USING BY REFERENCE 
   o   MOVE ... TO identifier 
   o   READ ... INTO identifier 
   o   RELEASE identifier FROM ... 
   o   RETURN ... INTO identifier 
   o   REWRITE identifier FROM ... 
   o   STRING ... INTO identifier 
   o   UNSTRING ... INTO identifier DELIMITER IN identifier 
   o   WRITE identifier FROM ... . 
<p>
 | The maximum length of variable-length groups is always used when they 
 | appear as the identifier on the CALL ... USING BY REFERENCE identifier 
 | statement.  Therefore, the object of the OCCURS DEPENDING ON clause does 
 | not need to be set. 
<p>
   In one record description entry, any entry that contains an OCCURS 
   DEPENDING ON clause can be followed only by items subordinate to it. 
<p>
   The OCCURS DEPENDING ON clause cannot be specified as subordinate to 
   another OCCURS clause. 
<p>
 x The following constitute complex OCCURS DEPENDING ON: 
<p>
 x o   Subordinate items can contain OCCURS DEPENDING ON clauses. 
<p>
 x o   Entries containing an OCCURS DEPENDING ON clause can be followed by 
 x     non-subordinate items.  Non-subordinate items, however, cannot be the 
 x     object of an OCCURS DEPENDING ON clause. 
<p>
 x     If the group item is followed by a non-subordinate item, the actual 
 x     length, rather than the maximum length, will be used.  At the time the 
 x     subject of entry is referenced, or any data item subordinate or 
 x     superordinate to the subject of entry is referenced, the object of the 
 x     OCCURS DEPENDING ON clause must fall within the range integer-1 
 x     through integer-2. 
<p>
 x o   The location of any subordinate or non-subordinate item, following an 
 x     item containing an OCCURS DEPENDING ON clause, is affected by the 
 x     value of the OCCURS DEPENDING ON object. 
<p>
 x o   Entries subordinate to the subject of an OCCURS DEPENDING ON clause 
 x     can contain OCCURS DEPENDING ON clauses. 
<p>
 x o   When implicit redefinition is used in a File Description (FD) entry, 
 x     subordinate level items can contain OCCURS DEPENDING ON clauses.

 x o   The INDEXED BY phrase can be specified for a table that has a

<p>
   The meaning of each PICTURE clause symbol is defined in Table 9 in 
   topic 2.7.7.1.  The sequence in which PICTURE clause symbols must be 
   specified is shown in Figure 5 in topic 2.7.7.1.  More detailed 
   explanations of PICTURE clause symbols follow the figures. 
<p>
   Any punctuation character appearing within the PICTURE character-string is 
   not considered a punctuation character, but rather a PICTURE 
   character-string symbol. 
<p>
   The lowercase letters corresponding to the uppercase letters representing 
   the PICTURE symbols A, B, P, S, V, X, Z, CR, and DB are equivalent to 
 x their uppercase representations in a PICTURE character-string.  The 
 x lowercase letters corresponding to the uppercase letters representing the 
 x PICTURE symbols E and G are equivalent to their uppercase representations 
 x in a PICTURE character-string.

   |________|_______________________________________________________________| 
   |    A   | A character position that can contain only a letter of the    | 
   |        | alphabet or a space.                                          | 
   |________|_______________________________________________________________| 
   |    B   | A character position into which the space character is        | 
   |        | inserted.                                                     | 
   |        |                                                               | 
 x |        | A character position into which a DBCS space is inserted.     | 
 x |        | For a DBCS item, each PICTURE symbol B occupies 2 bytes and   | 
 x |        | represents a single DBCS character position containing a DBCS | 
 x |        | space.                                                        | 
   |________|_______________________________________________________________| 
 x |   E    | Marks the start of the exponent in an external floating-point | 
 x |        | item.  It occupies 1 byte of storage.                         | 
   |________|_______________________________________________________________| 
 x |   G    | A Double Byte Character Set (DBCS) character position.  Each  | 
 x |        | PICTURE symbol G occupies 2 bytes of storage and represents a | 
 x |        | single DBCS character position.                               | 
   |________|_______________________________________________________________| 
   |   P    | An assumed decimal scaling position.  It is used to specify   | 
   |        | the location of an assumed decimal point when the point is    | 
   |        | not within the number that appears in the data item.  The     | 
   |        | scaling position character P is not counted in the size of    | 
   |        | the data item.  Scaling position characters are counted in    | 
   |        | determining the maximum number of digit positions (18) in     | 
   |        | numeric-edited items or in items that appear as arithmetic    | 
   |        | operands.                                                     | 
   |        |                                                               | 
   |        | The scaling position character P can appear only as a         | 
   |        | continuous string of Ps in the leftmost or rightmost digit    | 
   |        | positions within a PICTURE character-string.  Because the     | 
   |        | scaling position character P implies an assumed decimal point | 
   |        | (to the left of the Ps, if the Ps are leftmost PICTURE        | 
   |        | characters; to the right of the Ps, if the Ps are rightmost   | 
   |        | PICTURE characters), the assumed decimal point symbol, V, is  | 
   |        | redundant as either the leftmost or rightmost character       | 
   |        | within such a PICTURE description.                            | 
   |        |                                                               | 
   |        | In certain operations that reference a data item whose        | 
   |        | PICTURE character-string contains the symbol P, the algebraic | 
   |        | value of the data item is used rather than the actual         | 
   |        | character representation of the data item.  This algebraic    | 
   |        | value assumes the decimal point in the prescribed location    | 
   |        | and zero in place of the digit position specified by the      | 
   |        | symbol P.  The size of the value is the number of digit       | 
   |        | positions represented by the PICTURE character-string.  These | 
   |        | operations are any of the following:                          | 
   |        |                                                               | 
   |        | o   Any operation requiring a numeric sending operand.        | 
   |        | o   A MOVE statement where the sending operand is numeric and | 
   |        |     its PICTURE character-string contains the symbol P.       | 
   |        | o   A MOVE statement where the sending operand is             | 
   |        |     numeric-edited and its PICTURE character-string contains  | 
   |        |     the symbol P and the receiving operand is numeric or      | 
   |        |     numeric-edited.                                           | 
   |        | o   A comparison operation where both operands are numeric.   | 
   |        |                                                               | 
   |        | In all other operations the digit positions specified with    | 
   |        | the symbol P are ignored and are not counted in the size of   | 
   |        | the operand.                                                  | 
   |________|_______________________________________________________________| 
   |    S   | An indicator of the presence (but not the representation nor, | 
   |        | necessarily, the position) of an operational sign.  It must   | 
   |        | be written as the leftmost character in the PICTURE string.   | 
   |        | An operational sign indicates whether the value of an item    | 
   |        | involved in an operation is positive or negative.  The symbol | 
   |        | S is not counted in determining the size of the elementary    | 
   |        | item, unless an associated SIGN clause specifies the SEPARATE | 
   |        | CHARACTER phrase.                                             | 
   |________|_______________________________________________________________| 
   |    V   | An indicator of the location of the assumed decimal point.    | 
   |        | It can appear only once in a character-string.  The V does    | 
   |        | not represent a character position and, therefore, is not     | 
   |        | counted in the size of the elementary item.  When the assumed | 
   |        | decimal point is to the right of the rightmost symbol in the  | 
   |        | string, the V is redundant.                                   | 
   |________|_______________________________________________________________| 
   |    X   | A character position that can contain any allowable character | 
   |        | from the character set of the computer.                       | 
   |________|_______________________________________________________________| 
   |    Z   | A leading numeric character position; when that position      | 
   |        | contains a zero, the zero is replaced by a space character.   | 
   |        | Each Z is counted in the size of the item.                    | 
   |________|_______________________________________________________________| 
   |    9   | A character position that contains a numeral and is counted   | 
   |        | in the size of the item.                                      | 
   |________|_______________________________________________________________| 
   |    0   | A character position into which the numeral zero is inserted. | 
   |        | Each zero is counted in the size of the item.                 | 
   |________|_______________________________________________________________| 
   |    /   | A character position into which the slash character is        | 
   |        | inserted.  Each slash is counted in the size of the item.     | 
   |________|_______________________________________________________________| 
   |    ,   | A character position into which a comma is inserted.  This    | 
   |        | character is counted in the size of the item.  If the comma   | 
   |        | insertion character is the last symbol in the PICTURE         | 
   |        | character-string, the PICTURE clause must be the last clause  | 
   |        | of the data description entry and must be immediately         | 
   |        | followed by the separator period.                             | 
   |        |                                                               | 
 x |        | A trailing comma insertion character can be immediately       | 
 x |        | followed by the separator comma or separator semicolon; in    | 
 x |        | this case, the PICTURE clause need not be the last clause of  | 
 x |        | the data description entry.                                   | 
   |________|_______________________________________________________________| 
   |    .   | An editing symbol that represents the decimal point for       | 
   |        | alignment purposes.  In addition, it represents a character   | 
   |        | position into which a period is inserted.  This character is  | 
   |        | counted in the size of the item.  If the period insertion     | 
   |        | character is the last symbol in the PICTURE character-string, | 
   |        | the PICTURE clause must be the last clause of that data       | 
   |        | description entry and must be immediately followed by the     | 
   |        | separator period.                                             | 
   |        |                                                               | 
 x |        | A trailing period insertion character can be immediately      | 
 x |        | followed by the separator comma or separator semicolon; in    | 
 x |        | this case, the PICTURE clause need not be the last clause of  | 
 x |        | the data description entry.                                   | 
   |        |                                                               | 
   |        | <B>Note:</B>  For a given program, the functions of the period and   | 
   |        | comma are exchanged if the clause DECIMAL-POINT IS COMMA is   | 
   |        | specified in the SPECIAL-NAMES paragraph.  In this exchange,  | 
   |        | the rules for the period apply to the comma and the rules for | 
   |        | the comma apply to the period wherever they appear in a       | 
   |        | PICTURE clause.                                               | 
   |________|_______________________________________________________________| 
   |        | Editing sign control symbols.  Each represents the character  | 
   |   +    | position into which the editing sign control symbol is        | 
   |    -   | placed.  The symbols are mutually exclusive in one            | 
   |  CR    | character-string.  Each character used in the symbol is       | 
   |  DB    | counted in determining the size of the data item.             | 
   |        |                                                               |

   |________|_______________________________________________________________| 
   |    *   | A check protect symbol--a leading numeric character position  | 
   |        | into which an asterisk is placed when that position contains  | 
   |        | a zero.  Each asterisk (*) is counted in the size of the      | 
   |        | item.                                                         | 
   |________|_______________________________________________________________| 
   |   $    | A character position into which a currency symbol is placed.  | 
   |        | The currency symbol in a character-string is represented      | 
   |        | either by the symbol $ or by the single character in the      | 
   |        | CURRENCY SIGN clause in the SPECIAL-NAMES paragraph of the    | 
   |        | Environment Division.  The currency symbol is counted in the  | 
   |        | size of the item.                                             |

   The following symbols can appear more than once in one PICTURE 
   character-string: 
<p>
       A  B  P  X  Z  9  0  /  ,  +  -  *  $ 
<p>
 x     G 
<p>
   An unsigned nonzero integer enclosed in parentheses immediately following 
   any of these symbols specifies the number of consecutive occurrences of 
   that symbol. 
<p>
   For example, the following two PICTURE clause specifications are 
   equivalent: 
<p>
     <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>IS</samp> <samp>$99999.99CR</samp> 
     <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>IS</samp> <samp>$9(5).9(2)CR</samp>

<p>
       S  V  .  CR  DB 
<p>
 x     E 
<p>
<p>
   Each time any of the above symbols appears in the character-string, it 
   represents an occurrence of that character or set of allowable characters 
   in the data item.

           B  P  V  Z  9  0  /  ,  .  +  -  CR  DB  *  $ 
<p>
       The combinations of symbols allowed are determined from the PICTURE 
       clause symbol order allowed (see <A HREF=#2.7.7.1>Figure 5 in topic 2.7.7.1</A>), and the 
       editing rules (see <A HREF=#2.7.7.4>&quot;PICTURE Clause Editing&quot; in topic 2.7.7.4</A>).  The 
       following additional rules also apply: 
<p>
       -   Either the BLANK WHEN ZERO clause must be specified for the item, 
           or the string must contain at least one of the following symbols:

   There are two general methods of editing in a PICTURE clause: 
<p>
   o   Insertion editing 
<p>
       -   Simple insertion

   character in the character-string. 
<p>
   When CR or DB is used as a symbol, it must occupy the rightmost two 
   character positions in the character-string.  If these two character 
   positions contain the symbols CR or DB, the uppercase letters are the 
   insertion characters.

<A NAME=2.7.7.8><H3> 2.7.7.8   Floating Insertion Editing</H3></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   This type of editing is valid only for numeric-edited items.  The 
   following symbols are used: 
<p>
       $  +  - 
<p>
   Within one PICTURE character-string, these symbols are mutually exclusive 
   as floating insertion characters. 
<p>
   Floating insertion editing is specified by using a string of at least two 
   of the allowable floating insertion symbols to represent leftmost 
   character positions into which these actual characters can be inserted. 
<p>
   The leftmost floating insertion symbol in the character-string represents 
   the leftmost limit at which this actual character can appear in the data 
   item.  The rightmost floating insertion symbol represents the rightmost 
   limit at which this actual character can appear. 
<p>
   The second leftmost floating insertion symbol in the character-string 
   represents the leftmost limit at which numeric data can appear within the 
   data item.  Nonzero numeric data can replace all characters at or to the 
   right of this limit. 
<p>
 | Any simple-insertion symbols (B 0 / ,) within or to the immediate right of 
 | the string of floating insertion symbols are considered part of the 
 | floating character-string. 
<p>
   In a PICTURE character-string, there are two ways to represent floating 
   insertion editing and thus, two ways in which editing is performed: 
<p>
   1.  Any or all leading numeric character positions to the left of the 
       decimal point are represented by the floating insertion symbol.  When 
       editing is performed, a single floating insertion character is placed 
       to the immediate left of the first nonzero digit in the data, or of 
       the decimal point, whichever is farther to the left.  The character 
       positions to the left of the inserted character are filled with 
       spaces. 
<p>
 |     If all numeric character positions in the PICTURE character-string are

<p>
   2.  All the numeric character positions are represented by the floating 
       insertion symbol.  When editing is performed, then: 
<p>
       o   If the value of the data is zero, the entire data item will 
           contain spaces. 
       o   If the value of the data is nonzero, the result is the same as in 
           rule 1. 
<p>
<p>
   To avoid truncation, the minimum size of the PICTURE character-string must 
   be: 
<p>
   o   The number of character positions in the sending item, plus 
   o   The number of nonfloating insertion symbols in the receiving item, 
       plus 
   o   1 character for the floating insertion symbol.

<A NAME=2.7.7.9><H3> 2.7.7.9   Zero Suppression and Replacement Editing</H3></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   This type of editing is valid only for numeric-edited items.  In zero 
   suppression editing, the symbols Z and * are used.  These symbols are 
   mutually exclusive in one PICTURE character-string. 
<p>
   The following symbols are mutually exclusive as floating replacement 
   symbols in one PICTURE character-string: 
<p>
       Z  *  +  - $ 
<p>
   Specify zero suppression and replacement editing with a string of one or 
   more of the allowable symbols to represent leftmost character positions in 
   which zero suppression and replacement editing can be performed. 
<p>
 | Any simple insertion symbols (B 0 / ,) within or to the immediate right of 
 | the string of floating editing symbols are considered part of the string. 
<p>
   In a PICTURE character-string, there are two ways to represent zero 
   suppression, and two ways in which editing is performed: 
<p>
   o   Any or all of the leading numeric character positions to the left of 
       the decimal point are represented by suppression symbols.  When 
       editing is performed, any leading zero in the data that appears in the 
       same character position as a suppression symbol is replaced by the 
       replacement character.  Suppression stops at the leftmost character: 
<p>
       -   That does not correspond to a suppression symbol 
       -   That contains nonzero data 
       -   That is the decimal point. 
<p>
<p>
   o   All the numeric character positions in the PICTURE character-string 
       are represented by the suppression symbols.  When editing is 
       performed, and the value of the data is nonzero, the result is the 
       same as in the preceding rule.  If the value of the data is zero, 
       then: 
<p>
       -   If Z has been specified, the entire data item will contain spaces. 
<p>
       -   If * has been specified, the entire data item, except the actual 
           decimal point, will contain asterisks. 
<p>
   <B>Note:</B>  Do not specify both the asterisk (*) as a suppression symbol and 
   the BLANK WHEN ZERO clause for the same entry. 
<p>
   Examples of zero suppression and replacement editing:

   The REDEFINES clause allows you to use different data description entries 
   to describe the same computer storage area.

   <B>Note:</B>  Level-number, data-name-1, and FILLER are not part of the REDEFINES 
   clause itself, and are included in the format only for clarity. 
<p>
   When specified, the REDEFINES clause must be the first entry following 
   data-name-1 or FILLER.  If data-name-1 or FILLER is not specified, the 
   REDEFINES clause must be the first entry following the level-number. 
<p>
   The level-numbers of data-name-1 and data-name-2 must be identical, and 
   must not be level 66 or level 88. 
<p>
   <kbd>data-name-1,</kbd> <kbd>FILLER</kbd> 
       Identifies an alternate description for the same area, and is the 
       <B>redefining</B> item or the <B>REDEFINES</B> <B>subject</B>. 
<p>
 x     Data-name-1 can specify a DBCS, USAGE IS POINTER, or internal or 
 x     external floating-point data item. 
<p>
   <kbd>data-name-2</kbd> 
       Is the <B>redefined</B> item or the <B>REDEFINES</B> <B>object</B>. 
<p>
 x     Data-name-2 can specify a DBCS, USAGE IS POINTER, or internal or 
 x     external floating-point data item. 
<p>
   When more that one level-01 entry is written subordinate to an FD entry, a 
   condition known as implicit redefinition occurs.  That is, the second 
   level-01 entry implicitly redefines the storage allotted for the first 
   entry.  In such level-01 entries, the REDEFINES clause must not be 
   specified. 
<p>
   Redefinition begins at data-name-1 and ends when a level-number less than 
   or equal to that of data-name-1 is encountered.  No entry having a 
   level-number numerically lower than those of data-name-1 and data-name-2 
   can occur between these entries.  For example: 
<p>
     <samp>05</samp>    <samp>A</samp> <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>X(6).</samp> 
     <samp>05</samp>    <samp>B</samp> <samp>REDEFINES</samp> <samp>A.</samp> 
       <samp>10</samp> <samp>B-1</samp>                      <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>X(2).</samp> 
       <samp>10</samp> <samp>B-2</samp>                      <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>9(4).</samp> 
     <samp>05</samp>   <samp>C</samp>                        <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>99V99.</samp> 
<p>
   In this example, A is the redefined item, and B is the redefining item. 
   Redefinition begins with B and includes the two subordinate items B-1 and 
   B-2.  Redefinition ends when the level-05 item C is encountered. 
<p>
 x The data description entry for data-name-2, the redefined item, can 
 x contain a REDEFINES clause. 
<p>
   The data description entry for the redefined item cannot contain an OCCURS 
   clause with or without the DEPENDING ON option.  However, the redefined 
   item can be subordinate to an item whose data description entry contains 
   an OCCURS clause.  In this case, the reference to the redefined item in 
   the REDEFINES clause must not be subscripted.  Neither the original 
   definition nor the redefinition can include a variable occurrence data 
   item.  Neither the redefined item nor the redefining item, or any items 
   subordinate to them, can contain an OCCURS DEPENDING ON clause. 
<p>
   If the GLOBAL clause is used in the data description entry which contains 
   the REDEFINES clause, it is only the subject of that REDEFINES clause that 
   possesses the global attribute. 
<p>
   The EXTERNAL clause must not be specified on the same data description 
   entry as a REDEFINES clause. 
<p>
   If the data item referenced by data-name-2 is either declared to be an 
   external data record or is specified with a level-number other than 01, 
   the number of character positions it contains must be greater than or 
   equal to the number of character positions in the data item referenced by 
   the subject of this entry.  If the data-name referenced by data-name-2 is 
   specified with a level-number of 01 and is not declared to be an external 
 | data record, there is no such constraint; in this case, the storage 
 | allocated is the length of the larger data-item, either data-name-1 or 
 | data-name-2. 
<p>
 x When the data item implicitly redefines multiple 01-level records in a 
 x file description (FD) entry, items subordinate to the redefining or 
 x redefined item can contain an OCCURS DEPENDING ON clause. 
<p>
   One or more redefinitions of the same storage area are permitted.  The 
   entries giving the new descriptions of the storage area must immediately 
   follow the description of the redefined area without intervening entries 
   that define new character positions.  Multiple redefinitions must all use 
   the data-name of the original entry that defined this storage area.  For 
   example: 
<p>
     <samp>05</samp>    <samp>A</samp>                       <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>9999.</samp> 
     <samp>05</samp>    <samp>B</samp> <samp>REDEFINES</samp> <samp>A</samp>           <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>9V999.</samp> 
     <samp>05</samp>    <samp>C</samp> <samp>REDEFINES</samp> <samp>A</samp>           <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>99V99.</samp> 
<p>
   The redefining entry (identified by data-name-1), and any subordinate 
   entries, must not contain any VALUE clauses.

   Data items within an area can be redefined without changing their lengths. 
   For example: 
<p>
     <samp>05</samp>  <samp>NAME-2.</samp> 
       <samp>10</samp>  <samp>SALARY</samp>                  <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>XXX.</samp> 
       <samp>10</samp>  <samp>SO-SEC-NO</samp>               <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>X(9).</samp> 
       <samp>10</samp>  <samp>MONTH</samp>                   <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>XX.</samp> 
     <samp>05</samp>  <samp>NAME-1</samp> <samp>REDEFINES</samp> <samp>NAME-2.</samp> 
       <samp>10</samp>  <samp>WAGE</samp>                    <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>XXX.</samp> 
       <samp>10</samp>  <samp>EMP-NO</samp>                  <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>X(9).</samp> 
       <samp>10</samp>  <samp>YEAR</samp>                    <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>XX.</samp> 
<p>
<p>
   Data item lengths and types can also be respecified within an area.  For 
   example: 
<p>
     <samp>05</samp>  <samp>NAME-2.</samp> 
       <samp>10</samp>  <samp>SALARY</samp>                  <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>XXX.</samp> 
       <samp>10</samp>  <samp>SO-SEC-NO</samp>               <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>X(9).</samp> 
       <samp>10</samp>  <samp>MONTH</samp>                   <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>XX.</samp> 
     <samp>05</samp>  <samp>NAME-1</samp> <samp>REDEFINES</samp> <samp>NAME-2.</samp> 
       <samp>10</samp>  <samp>WAGE</samp>                    <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>999V999.</samp> 
       <samp>10</samp>  <samp>EMP-NO</samp>                  <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>X(6).</samp> 
       <samp>10</samp>  <samp>YEAR</samp>                    <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>XX.</samp> 
<p>
   When an area is redefined, all descriptions of the area are always in 
   effect; that is, redefinition does not cause any data to be erased and 
   never supersedes a previous description.  Thus, if B REDEFINES C has been 
   specified, either of the two procedural statements, <tt>MOVE</tt> <tt>X</tt> <tt>TO</tt> <tt>B</tt> and <tt>MOVE</tt> <tt>Y</tt> 
   <tt>TO</tt> <tt>C</tt>, could be executed at any point in the program. 
<p>
   In the first case, the area described as B would assume the value and 
   format of X.  In the second case, the same physical area (described now as 
   C) would assume the value and format of Y.  Note that, if the second 
   statement is executed immediately after the first, the value of Y replaces 
   the value of X in the one storage area. 
<p>
   The usage of a redefining data item need not be the same as that of a 
   redefined item.  This does not, however, cause any change in existing 
   data.  For example: 
<p>
     <samp>05</samp>  <samp>B</samp>                      <samp>PICTURE</samp>  <samp>99</samp> <samp>USAGE</samp> <samp>DISPLAY</samp> <samp>VALUE</samp> <samp>8.</samp> 
     <samp>05</samp>  <samp>C</samp> <samp>REDEFINES</samp> <samp>B</samp>          <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>S99</samp> <samp>USAGE</samp> <samp>COMPUTATIONAL-4.</samp> 
     <samp>05</samp>  <samp>A</samp>                      <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>S99</samp> <samp>USAGE</samp> <samp>COMPUTATIONAL-4.</samp> 
<p>
   The bit configuration of the <tt>DISPLAY</tt> <tt>VALUE</tt> <tt>8</tt> is: 
<p>
     <samp>1111</samp> <samp>0000</samp> <samp>1111</samp> <samp>1000.</samp> 
<p>
   Redefining B does not change the bit configuration of the data in the 
   storage area.  Therefore, the following two statements produce different 
   results: 
<p>
     <samp>ADD</samp> <samp>B</samp> <samp>TO</samp> <samp>A</samp> 
     <samp>ADD</samp> <samp>C</samp> <samp>TO</samp> <samp>A</samp> 
<p>
   In the first case, the value 8 is added to A (because B has <tt>USAGE</tt> 
   <tt>DISPLAY</tt>).  In the second statement, the value -3848 is added to A (because 
   C has <tt>USAGE</tt> <tt>COMPUTATIONAL-4</tt>), and the bit configuration of the storage 
   area has the binary value -3848. 
<p>
   The above example demonstrates how the improper use of redefinition can 
   give unexpected or incorrect results.

   The special level-number 66 must be specified for data description entries 
   that contain the RENAMES clause.  Level-number 66 and data-name-1 are not 
   part of the RENAMES clause itself, and are included in the format only for 
   clarity. 
<p>
   One or more RENAMES entries can be written for a logical record.  All 
   RENAMES entries associated with one logical record must immediately follow 
   that record's last data description entry. 
<p>
   <kbd>data-name-1</kbd> 
       Identifies an alternative grouping of data items. 
<p>
       A level-66 entry cannot rename a level-01, level-77, level-88, or 
       another level-66 entry. 
<p>
       Data-name-1 cannot be used as a qualifier; it can be qualified only by 
       the names of level indicator entries or level-01 entries. 
<p>
 x     Can specify a DBCS data item if data-name-2 specifies a DBCS data item 
 x     and the THROUGH phrase is not specified. 
<p>
   <kbd>data-name-2,</kbd> <kbd>data-name-3</kbd> 
       Identify the original grouping of elementary data items; that is, they 
       must name elementary or group items within the associated level-01 
       entry, and must not be the same data-name.  Both data-names can be 
       qualified. 
<p>
       The OCCURS clause must not be specified in the data entries for 
       data-name-2 and data-name-3, or for any group entry to which they are 
       subordinate.  In addition, the OCCURS DEPENDING ON clause must not be 
       specified for any item defined between data-name-2 and data-name-3. 
<p>
       When data-name-3 is specified, data-name-1 is treated as a group item 
       that includes all elementary items: 
<p>
       o   Starting with data-name-2 (if it is an elementary item) or the 
           first elementary item within data-name-2 (if it is a group item) 
<p>
       o   Ending with data-name-3 (if it is an elementary item) or the last 
           elementary item within data-name-3 (if it is a group item). 
<p>
       The keywords THROUGH and THRU are equivalent. 
<p>
       The leftmost character in data-name-3 must not precede the leftmost 
       character in data-name-2; the rightmost character in data-name-3 must 
       not precede the rightmost character in data-name-2.  This means that 
       data-name-3 cannot be totally subordinate to data-name-2. 
<p>
       When data-name-3 is not specified, all of the data attributes of 
       data-name-2 become the data attributes for data-name-1. That is: 
<p>
       o   When data-name-2 is a group item, data-name-1 is treated as a 
           group item. 
<p>
       o   When data-name-2 is an elementary item, data-name-1 is treated as 
           an elementary item.

    ___ <A NAME=sign-clause>sign-clause</A> _______________________________________________________________

   |                                                                               |
   |_______________________________________________________________________________|

   The SIGN clause can be specified only for a signed numeric data 
   description entry (that is, one whose PICTURE character-string contains an 
   S), or for a group item that contains at least one such elementary entry. 
   USAGE IS DISPLAY must be specified, explicitly or implicitly. 
<p>
   If a SIGN clause is specified in either an elementary or group entry 
   subordinate to a group item for which a SIGN clause is specified, the SIGN 
   clause for the subordinate entry takes precedence for the subordinate 
   entry. 
<p>
   If you specify the CODE-SET clause in an FD entry, any signed numeric data 
   description entries associated with that file description entry must be 
   described with the SIGN IS SEPARATE clause. 
<p>
   The SIGN clause is required only when an explicit description of the 
   properties and/or position of the operational sign is necessary. 
<p>
   When specified, the SIGN clause defines the position and mode of 
   representation of the operational sign for the numeric data description 
   entry to which it applies, or for each signed numeric data description 
   entry subordinate to the group to which it applies. 
<p>
   If the SEPARATE CHARACTER phrase is not specified, then: 
<p>
   o   The operational sign is presumed to be associated with the LEADING or 
       TRAILING digit position, whichever is specified, of the elementary 
       numeric data item.  (In this instance, specification of SIGN IS 
       TRAILING is the equivalent of the standard action of the compiler.) 
<p>
   o   The character S in the PICTURE character string is not counted in 
       determining the size of the item (in terms of standard data format 
       characters). 
<p>
   If the SEPARATE CHARACTER phrase is specified, then: 
<p>
   o   The operational sign is presumed to be the LEADING or TRAILING 
       character position, whichever is specified, of the elementary numeric 
       data item.  This character position is not a digit position. 
<p>
   o   The character S in the PICTURE character string is counted in 
       determining the size of the data item (in terms of standard data 
       format characters). 
<p>
   o   + is the character used for the positive operational sign. 
<p>
   o   - is the character used for the negative operational sign. 
<p>
   Every numeric data description entry whose PICTURE contains the symbol S 
   is a signed numeric data description entry.  If the SIGN clause is also 
   specified for such an entry, and conversion is necessary for computations 
   or comparisons, the conversion takes place automatically. 
<p>
 x The SIGN clause is treated as documentation for external floating-point 
 x items.  For internal floating-point items, the SIGN clause is invalid and 
 x will result in an S-level diagnostic message.

   |_________________________________________|

   SYNC is an abbreviation for SYNCHRONIZED and has the same meaning. 
<p>
   The SYNCHRONIZED clause is never required, but may improve performance on 
   some systems for binary items used in arithmetic. 
<p>
   The SYNCHRONIZED clause be specified only at the elementary level. 
<p>
 x The SYNCHRONIZED clause be specified for level-01 group items, in which 
 x case every elementary item within the level-01 group item is synchronized. 
<p>
   <kbd>LEFT</kbd> 
       Specifies that the elementary item is to be positioned so that it will 
       begin at the left character position of the natural boundary in which 
       the elementary item is placed. 
<p>
   <kbd>RIGHT</kbd> 
       Specifies that the elementary item is to be positioned such that it 
       will terminate on the right character position of the natural boundary 
       in which it has been placed. 
<p>
 | When specified, the LEFT and the RIGHT phrases are syntax-checked, but are 
 | treated as documentation. 
<p>
   The length of an elementary item is not affected by the SYNCHRONIZED 
   clause. 
<p>
   When the SYNCHRONIZED clause is specified for an item within the scope of 
   an OCCURS clause, each occurrence of the item is synchronized. 
<p>
 | The SYNCHRONIZED clause for a DISPLAY or PACKED-DECIMAL item is 
 | syntax-checked, but is treated as documentation. 
<p>
   When the SYNCHRONIZED clause is specified for a BINARY or COMPUTATIONAL 
   item that is the first elementary item subordinate to an item that 
   contains a REDEFINES clause, the item must not require the addition of 
   unused character positions. 
<p>
 | When the synchronized clause is specified for a subordinate data item (one 
   with a level number of 02 through 49): 
<p>
   o   The item is aligned at a displacement that is a multiple of 2 relative 
       to the beginning of the record, if its USAGE is BINARY and its PICTURE 
       is in the range of S9 through S9(4). 
<p>
   o   The item is aligned at a displacement that is a multiple of 4 relative 
       to the beginning of the record, if its USAGE is BINARY and its PICTURE 
 x     is in the range of S9(5) through S9(18), or its USAGE is INDEX. 
<p>
   When SYNCHRONIZED is not specified for binary items, no space is reserved 
   for slack bytes. 
<p>
 x The SYNCHRONIZED clause for a USAGE IS POINTER data item aligns the data 
 x on a fullword boundary. 
<p>
 x The SYNCHRONIZED clause for a COMPUTATIONAL-1 data item aligns the data on 
 x a fullword boundary. 
<p>
 x The SYNCHRONIZED clause for a COMPUTATIONAL-2 data item aligns the data on 
 x a doubleword boundary. 
<p>
 x The SYNCHRONIZED clause for a COMPUTATIONAL-3 data item is treated the 
 x same as the SYNCHRONIZED clause for a PACKED-DECIMAL item. 
<p>
 x The SYNCHRONIZED clause for a COMPUTATIONAL-4 item is treated the same as 
 x the SYNCHRONIZED clause for a COMPUTATIONAL item. 
<p>
 x The SYNCHRONIZED clause is ignored for a DBCS item and floating-point data 
 x items. 
<p>
   When the SYNCHRONIZED clause is specified for an item that also contains a 
   REDEFINES clause, the data item that is redefined must have the proper 
   boundary alignment for the data item that redefines it.  For example, if 
   you write the following, be sure that data item A begins on a fullword 
   boundary: 
<p>
     <samp>02</samp> <samp>A</samp>                     <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>X(4).</samp> 
     <samp>02</samp> <samp>B</samp> <samp>REDEFINES</samp> <samp>A</samp>         <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>S9(9)</samp> <samp>BINARY</samp> <samp>SYNC.</samp> 
<p>
   In the File Section, the compiler assumes that all level-01 records 
   containing SYNCHRONIZED items are aligned on doubleword boundaries in the 
   buffer.  You must provide the necessary slack bytes between records to 
   ensure alignment when there are multiple records in a block. 
<p>
   In the Working-Storage Section, the compiler aligns all level-01 entries 
   on a doubleword boundary. 
<p>
   For the purposes of aligning binary items in the Linkage Section, all 
   level-01 items are assumed to begin on doubleword boundaries.  Therefore, 
   if you issue a CALL statement, such operands of any USING phrase within it 
   must be aligned correspondingly.

<A NAME=2.7.11.2><H3> 2.7.11.2   Slack Bytes within Records</H3></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   For an output file, or in the Working-Storage Section, the compiler 
   inserts slack bytes within a record to ensure that all SYNCHRONIZED items 
   are on their proper boundaries.  For an input file, or in the Linkage 
   Section, performance is improved if binary items are properly aligned. 
<p>
   Because it is important that you know the length of the records in a file, 
   you need to determine whether slack bytes are required and, if necessary, 
   how many to add.  The algorithm the compiler uses to calculate this is as 
   follows: 
<p>
   o   The total number of bytes occupied by all elementary data items 
       preceding the binary item are added together, including any slack 
       bytes previously added. 
<p>
   o   This sum is divided by <I>m</I>, where: 
<p>
           <I>m</I> = 2 for binary items of 4-digit length or less 
<p>
           <I>m</I> = 4 for binary items of 5-digit length or more and for USAGE IS 
           INDEX data items 
<p>
 x         <I>m</I> = 4 for USAGE IS POINTER and COMPUTATIONAL-1 data items 
<p>
 x         <I>m</I> = 8 for COMPUTATIONAL-2 data items. 
<p>
   o   If the remainder (<I>r</I>) of this division is equal to zero, no slack bytes 
       are required.  If the remainder is not equal to zero, the number of 
       slack bytes that must be added is equal to <I>m</I> - <I>r</I>. 
<p>
   These slack bytes are added to each record immediately following the 
   elementary data item preceding the binary item.  They are defined as if 
   they constituted an item with a level number equal to that of the 
   elementary item that immediately precedes the SYNCHRONIZED binary item, 
   and are included in the size of the group that contains them. 
<p>
   For example:

   Slack bytes may also be added by the compiler when a group item is defined 
   with an OCCURS clause and contains within it a SYNCHRONIZED binary data 
   item.  To determine whether slack bytes are to be added, the following 
   action is taken: 
<p>
   o   The compiler calculates the size of the group, including all the 
       necessary slack bytes within a record. 
<p>
   o   This sum is divided by the largest <I>m</I> required by any elementary item 
       within the group. 
<p>
   o   If <I>r</I> is equal to zero, no slack bytes are required.  If <I>r</I> is not equal 
       to zero, <I>m</I> - <I>r</I> slack bytes must be added. 
<p>
 | The slack bytes are inserted before the SYNCHRONIZED items within each 
   occurrence of the group item containing the OCCURS clause.  For example, a 
   record defined as follows will appear in storage as shown in Figure 7: 
<p>
<p>
     <samp>01</samp> <samp>WORK-RECORD.</samp>

<p>
   In order to align <tt>COMP-PAY</tt> and <tt>COMP-HRS</tt> upon their proper boundaries, the 
   compiler has added two slack bytes within the record. 
<p>
   In the previous example, without further adjustment, the second occurrence 
   of <tt>COMP-TABLE</tt> would begin one byte before a doubleword boundary, and the 
   alignment of <tt>COMP-PAY</tt> and <tt>COMP-HRS</tt> would not be valid for any occurrence 
   of the table after the first.  Therefore, the compiler must add slack 
 | bytes at the end of each occurrence of the group item containing the 
 | OCCURS clause, as though the record had been written as follows: 
<p>

<p>
   If the file contains blocked logical records that are to be processed in a 
   buffer, and any of the records contain binary entries for which the 
   SYNCHRONIZED clause is specified, you can improve performance by adding 
   any needed slack bytes between records for proper alignment. 
<p>
   The lengths of all the elementary data items in the record, including all 
   slack bytes, are added.  (For variable-length records, it is necessary to 
   add an additional 4 bytes for the count field.)  The total is then divided 
   by the highest value of <I>m</I> for any one of the elementary items in the 
   record. 
<p>
   If <I>r</I> (the remainder) is equal to zero, no slack bytes are required.  If <I>r</I> 
   is not equal to zero, <I>m</I> - <I>r</I> slack bytes are required.  These slack bytes 
   can be specified by writing a level-02 FILLER at the end of the record. 
<p>
   To show the method of calculating slack bytes both within and between 
   records, consider the following record description: 
<p>
     <samp>01</samp>  <samp>COMP-RECORD.</samp> 
       <samp>05</samp>  <samp>A-1</samp>            <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>X(5).</samp>

       <samp>05</samp>  <samp>A-3</samp>            <samp>PICTURE</samp> <samp>X(3).</samp>

<p>
   The number of bytes in A-1, A-2, and A-3 totals 11.  B-1 is a 4-digit 
   COMPUTATIONAL item and 1 slack byte must therefore be added before B-1. 
   With this byte added, the number of bytes preceding B-2 totals 14. 
   Because B-2 is a COMPUTATIONAL item of 5 digits in length, two slack bytes 
   must be added before it.  No slack bytes are needed before B-3. 
<p>
   The revised record description entry now appears as: 
<p>
     <samp>01</samp>  <samp>COMP-RECORD.</samp>

<p>
   There is a total of 22 bytes in <tt>COMP-RECORD</tt>, but, from the rules given in 
   the preceding discussion, it appears that <I>m</I> = 4 and <I>r</I> = 2.  Therefore, to 
   attain proper alignment for blocked records, you must add 2 slack bytes at 
   the end of the record.

 | A computational item is a value that can be used in arithmetic operations. 
   It must be numeric.  If the USAGE of a group item is described with any of 
   these items, the elementary items within the group have this usage. 
<p>
   The maximum length of a computational item is 18 decimal digits. 
<p>
   The PICTURE of a computational item can contain only: 
<p>
   9    one or more numeric character positions 
   S    One operational sign 
   V    One implied decimal point 
   P    One or more decimal scaling positions.

       consisting of the decimal digits 0 through 9, plus a sign.  Negative 
       numbers are represented as the two's complement of the positive number 
       with the same absolute value.

       The leftmost bit of the storage area is the operational sign. 
<p>
   <kbd>PACKED-DECIMAL</kbd> 
       Specified for internal decimal items.  Such an item appears in storage 
       in packed decimal format.  There are 2 digits for each character 
       position, except for the trailing character position, which is 
       occupied by the low-order digit and the sign.  Such an item can 
       contain any of the digits 0 through 9, plus a sign, representing a 
       value not exceeding 18 decimal digits. 
<p>
       The sign representation uses the same bit configuration as the 4-bit 
       sign representation in zoned decimal fields (see <A HREF=#2.7.12.2>Table 12 in</A>

       Representation of the COMPUTATIONAL phrase is system-dependent and is 
       normally assigned to representations that yield the greatest 
       efficiency when arithmetic operations are performed on that system. 
       For the VS COBOL II compiler, the COMPUTATIONAL phrase is synonymous

 x     Specified for internal floating-point items (single precision). 
 x     COMP-1 items are 4 bytes long.  The sign is contained in the first bit 
 x     of the leftmost byte and the exponent is contained in the remaining 7 
 x     bits.  The last 3 bytes contain the mantissa.

   USAGE IS DISPLAY is valid for the following types of items: 
<p>
   o   Alphabetic 
   o   Alphanumeric 
   o   Alphanumeric-edited 
   o   Numeric-edited 
 x o   External floating-point 
   o   External decimal (numeric). 
<p>
   <B>Alphabetic</B>, <B>alphanumeric</B>, <B>alphanumeric-edited</B>, and <B>numeric-edited</B> items 
   are discussed in <A HREF=#2.7.7.3>&quot;Data Categories and PICTURE Rules&quot; in topic 2.7.7.3</A>. 
<p>
   <B>External</B> <B>Decimal</B> <B>Items</B> are sometimes referred to as <B>zoned</B> <B>decimal</B> items. 
   Each digit of a number is represented by a single byte.  The 4 high-order 
   bits of each byte are zone bits; the 4 high-order bits of the low-order 
   byte represent the sign of the item.  The 4 low-order bits of each byte 
   contain the value of the digit. 
<p>
   The maximum length of an external decimal item is 18 digits. 
<p>
   The PICTURE character-string of an external decimal item can contain only 
   9s; the operational-sign, S; the assumed decimal point, V; and one or more 
   Ps.

<A NAME=2.7.12.4><H3> 2.7.12.4   INDEX Phrase</H3></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   A data item defined with the INDEX phrase is an <B>index</B> <B>data</B> <B>item</B>. 
<p>
   An <B>index</B> <B>data</B> <B>item</B> is a 4-byte elementary item (not necessarily connected 
   with any table) that can be used to save index-name values for future 
   reference.  Through a SET statement, an index data item can be assigned an 
   index-name value; such a value corresponds to the occurrence number in a 
   table. 
<p>
   Direct references to an index data item can be made only in a SEARCH 
   statement, a SET statement, a relation condition, the USING phrase of the 
   Procedure Division header, or the USING phrase of the CALL statement. 
<p>
 x An index data item can be referred to directly in the USING phrase of an 
 x ENTRY statement. 
<p>
   An index data item can be part of a group item referred to in a MOVE 
   statement or an input/output statement. 
<p>
   An index data item saves values that represent table occurrences, yet is 
   not necessarily defined as part of any table.  Thus, when it is referred 
   to directly in a SEARCH or SET statement, or indirectly in a MOVE or 
   input/output statement, there is no conversion of values when the 
   statement is executed. 
<p>
   The USAGE IS INDEX clause can be written at any level.  If a group item is

<p>
   The VALUE clause specifies the initial contents of a data item or the 
   value(s) associated with a condition-name. 
<p>
   The use of the VALUE clause differs depending on the Data Division section 
   in which it is specified. 
<p>
   In the File and Linkage Sections, the VALUE clause must be used only in 
   condition-name entries. 
<p>
 x In the File and Linkage Sections, if the VALUE clause is used in entries 
 x other than condition-name entries, the VALUE clause is treated as a 
 x comment. 
<p>
   In the Working-Storage Section, the VALUE clause can be used in 
   condition-name entries, or in specifying the initial value of any data 
   item.  The data item assumes the specified value at the beginning of 
   program execution.  If the initial value is not explicitly specified, it 
   is unpredictable.

   Format 1 specifies the initial value of a data item.  Initialization is 
   independent of any BLANK WHEN ZERO or JUSTIFIED clause specified. 
<p>
   A format 1 VALUE clause specified in a data description entry that 
   contains or is subordinate to an OCCURS clause causes every occurrence of 
   the associated data item to be assigned the specified value.  Each 
   structure that contains the DEPENDING ON phrase of the OCCURS clause is 
   assumed to contain the maximum number of occurrences for the purposes of 
   VALUE initialization.

 x <cite>Guide</cite> <cite>for</cite> <cite>VSE.</cite> 
<p>
   The VALUE clause must not be specified for a data description entry that 
   contains, or is subordinate to, an entry containing either an EXTERNAL or 
   a REDEFINES clause.  This rule does not apply to condition-name entries. 
<p>
   If the VALUE clause is specified at the group level, the literal must be a 
   nonnumeric literal or a figurative constant.  The group area is 
   initialized without consideration for the subordinate entries within this 
   group.  In addition, the VALUE clause must not be specified for 
   subordinate entries within this group. 
<p>
   For group entries, the VALUE clause must not be specified if the entry 
   also contains any of the following clauses:  JUSTIFIED, SYNCHRONIZED, or 
   USAGE (other than USAGE DISPLAY). 
<p>
   The VALUE clause must not conflict with other clauses in the data 
   description entry, or in the data description of this entry's hierarchy. 
<p>
 x Any VALUE clause associated with COMPUTATIONAL-1 or COMPUTATIONAL-2 
 x (internal floating-point) items must specify a floating-point literal. 
 x The condition-name VALUE phrase must also specify a floating-point 
 x literal.  In addition, the figurative constant ZERO and both integer and 
 x decimal forms of the zero literal can be specified in a floating-point 
 x VALUE clause or condition-name VALUE phrase. 
<p>
 x For information on floating-point literal values, see<A HREF=#1.1.1.12> &quot;Rules for</A> 
 x <A HREF=#1.1.1.12>Floating-point Literal Values:&quot; in topic 1.1.1.12</A>. 
<p>
 x A VALUE clause cannot be specified for external floating-point items. 
<p>
 x A VALUE clause associated with a DBCS item must contain a DBCS literal or 
 x the figurative constant SPACE. 
<p>
 x A data item cannot contain a VALUE clause if the prior data item contains 
 x a OCCURS clause with the DEPENDING ON phrase. 
<p>
<p>
   <I>Rules</I> <I>for</I> <I>Literal</I> <I>Values:</I> 
<p>
   o   Wherever a literal is specified, a figurative constant can be 
       substituted. 
<p>
   o   If the item is numeric, all VALUE clause literals must be numeric.  If 
       the literal defines the value of a Working-Storage item, the literal 
       is aligned according to the rules for numeric moves, with one 
       additional restriction:  The literal must not have a value that 
       requires truncation of nonzero digits.  If the literal is signed, the 
       associated PICTURE character-string must contain a sign symbol (S). 
<p>
   o   All numeric literals in a VALUE clause of an item must have a value 
       that is within the range of values indicated by the PICTURE clause for 
       that item.  For example, for PICTURE 99PPP, the literal must be within 
       the range 1000 through 99000, or zero.  For PICTURE PPP99, the literal 
       must be within the range 0.00000 through 0.00099. 
<p>
   o   If the item is an elementary or group alphabetic, alphanumeric, 
       alphanumeric-edited, or numeric-edited item, all VALUE clause literals 
       must be nonnumeric literals.  The literal is aligned according to the 
       alphanumeric alignment rules, with one additional restriction:  The 
       number of characters in the literal must not exceed the size of the 
       item. 
<p>
   o   The functions of the editing characters in a PICTURE clause are 
       ignored in determining the initial appearance of the item described. 
       However, editing characters are included in determining the size of 
       the item.  Therefore, any editing characters must be included in the 
       literal.  For example, if the item is defined as PICTURE +999.99 and 
       the value is to be +12.34, then the VALUE clause should be specified 
       as VALUE &quot;+012.34&quot;.

<p>
   This format associates a value, values, and/or range(s) of values with a 
   condition-name.  Each such condition-name requires a separate level-88 
   entry.  Level-number 88 and condition-name are not part of the Format 2 
   VALUE clause itself.  They are included in the format only for clarity. 
<p>
 | <kbd>condition-name-1</kbd> 
       Is a user-specified name that associates a value with a conditional 
       variable.  If the associated conditional variable requires subscripts 
       or indexes, each procedural reference to the condition-name must be 
       subscripted or indexed as required for the conditional variable. 
<p>
 |     Condition-name-1 is tested procedurally in condition-name conditions 
       (see <A HREF=#2.8.5>&quot;Conditional Expressions&quot; in topic 2.8.5</A>). 
<p>
   <kbd>literal-1</kbd> 
       When literal-1 is specified alone, the condition-name is associated 
       with a single value. 
<p>
   <kbd>literal-1</kbd> <kbd>THROUGH</kbd> <kbd>literal-2</kbd> 
       The condition-name is associated with at least one range of values. 
       Whenever the THROUGH phrase is used, literal-1 must be less than 
       literal-2. 
<p>
 | In the VALUE clause of a data description entry (Format 2), all the 
 | literals specified in the VALUE clause must be DBCS literals if the 
 x associated conditional variable is a DBCS data item.  The figurative 
 x constants SPACE and SPACES can be used as DBCS literals. 
<p>
 x The range of DBCS literals specified for the THROUGH phrase is based on 
 x the binary collating sequence of the hexadecimal values of the DBCS 
 x characters. 
<p>
<p>
   <I>Rules</I> <I>for</I> <I>Condition-Name</I> <I>Values:</I> 
<p>
   o   The VALUE clause is required in a condition-name entry, and must be 
       the only clause in the entry.  Each condition-name entry is associated 
       with a preceding conditional variable.  Thus, every level-88 entry 
       must always be preceded either by the entry for the conditional 
       variable, or by another level-88 entry when several condition-names 
       apply to one conditional variable.  Each such level-88 entry 
       implicitly has the PICTURE characteristics of the conditional 
       variable. 
<p>
   o   The keywords THROUGH and THRU are equivalent. 
<p>
       The condition-name entries associated with a particular conditional 
       variable must immediately follow the conditional variable entry.  The 
       conditional variable can be any elementary data description entry 
       except another condition-name, a RENAMES clause (level-66 item), or an 
       item with USAGE IS INDEX. 
<p>
 x     The conditional variable cannot be an item described as USAGE IS 
 x     POINTER. 
<p>
       A condition-name can be associated with a group item data description 
       entry.  In this case: 
<p>
       -   The condition-name value must be specified as a nonnumeric literal 
           or figurative constant. 
<p>
       -   The size of the condition-name value must not exceed the sum of 
           the sizes of all the elementary items within the group. 
<p>
       -   No element within the group can contain a JUSTIFIED or 
           SYNCHRONIZED clause. 
<p>
       -   No USAGE other than DISPLAY can be specified within the group. 
<p>
 x         USAGE other than USAGE IS DISPLAY can be specified within the 
 x         group. 
<p>
       Condition-names can be specified both at the group level and at 
       subordinate levels within the group. 
<p>
       The relation test implied by the definition of a condition-name at the 
       group level is performed in accordance with the rules for comparison 
       of nonnumeric operands, regardless of the nature of elementary items 
       within the group. 
<p>
 x     The VALUE clause is allowed for internal floating-point data items. 
<p>
 x     The VALUE clause is allowed for DBCS data items.  Relation tests for 
 x     DBCS data items are performed according to the rules for comparison of 
 x     DBCS items.  These rules can be found in <A HREF=#2.8.5.5.5>&quot;Comparing DBCS Operands&quot; in</A> 
 x     <A HREF=#2.8.5.5.5>topic 2.8.5.5.5</A>. 
<p>
       A space, a separator comma, or a separator semicolon, must separate 
       successive operands. 
<p>
       Each entry must end with a separator period. 
<p>
   o   The type of literal in a condition-name entry must be consistent with 
       the data type of its conditional variable.  In the following example: 
<p>
       -   CITY-COUNTY-INFO, COUNTY-NO, and CITY are conditional variables. 
<p>
           The PICTURE associated with COUNTY-NO limits the condition-name 
           value to a 2-digit numeric literal. 
<p>
           The PICTURE associated with CITY limits the condition-name value 
           to a 3-character nonnumeric literal. 
<p>
       -   The associated condition-names are level-88 entries. 
<p>
           Any values for the condition-names associated with 
           CITY-COUNTY-INFO cannot exceed 5 characters. 
<p>
           Because this is a group item, the literal must be nonnumeric.

   The USING phrase is required only if the object program is to be invoked

<A NAME=2.8.1.1><H3> 2.8.1.1   The USING Phrase</H3></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   The USING phrase makes data items defined in a calling program available 
   to a called subprogram. 
<p>
   The USING phrase is specified in the Procedure Division header if, and 
   only if, this program is a subprogram invoked by a CALL statement that 
   itself contains a USING phrase.  That is, for each CALL USING statement in 
   a calling program, there must be a corresponding USING phrase specified in 
   a called subprogram. 
<p>
   The USING phrase is valid in the Procedure Division header of a called 
   subprogram entered at the beginning of the nondeclaratives portion; each 
   USING identifier must be defined as a level-01 or level-77 item in the 
   Linkage Section of the called subprogram; it must not contain a REDEFINES 
   clause. 
<p>
 x A data item in the USING phrase of the Procedure Division header can have 
 x a REDEFINES clause in its data description entry. 
<p>
 x In a called subprogram entered at the first executable statement following 
 x an ENTRY statement, the USING option is valid in the ENTRY statement; each 
 x USING identifier must be defined as a level-01 or level-77 item in the 
 x Linkage Section of the called subprogram. 
<p>
   In a calling program, the USING phrase is valid for the CALL statement; 
   each USING identifier must be defined as a level-01, level-77, or an 
   elementary item in the Data Division. 
<p>
 x Each USING identifier in a calling program can be a data item of any level 
 x in the Data Division. 
<p>
   It is possible to call from non-COBOL programs or pass user parameters 
   from a system EXEC to a COBOL main program. 
<p>
   The order of appearance of USING identifiers in both calling and called 
   subprograms determines the correspondence of single sets of data available 
   to both programs.  The correspondence is positional and not by name. 
   Corresponding identifiers must contain the same number of characters, 
   although their data descriptions need not be the same.  For index-names, 
   no correspondence is established; index-names in calling and called 
   programs always refer to separate indexes. 
<p>
   The identifiers specified in a CALL USING statement name data items 
   available to the calling program that can be referred to in the called 
   program; a given identifier can appear more than once.  These items are 
   defined in any Data Division section.  An identifier can appear only once 
   in a Procedure Division USING phrase. 
<p>
 x An identifier can appear more than once in a Procedure Division USING 
 x phrase.  The last value passed to it by a CALL USING statement is used. 
<p>
   Data items defined in the Linkage Section of the called program can be 
   referenced within the Procedure Division of that program if, and only if, 
   they satisfy one of the following conditions: 
<p>
   o   They are operands of the USING phrase of the Procedure Division header 
 x     or the ENTRY statement 
<p>
 x o   They are operands of SET ADDRESS OF or CALL...BY REFERENCE ADDRESS OF 
<p>
   o   They are defined with a REDEFINES or RENAMES clause, the object of 
       which satisfies the above conditions 
<p>
   o   They are items subordinate to any item that satisfies the condition in 
       the rules above 
<p>
   o   They are condition-names or index-names associated with data items 
       that satisfy any of the above conditions. 
<p>
   If the reference to the corresponding data item in the CALL statement 
   declares the parameter to be passed BY REFERENCE (explicit or implicit), 
   the object program executes as if each reference to a USING identifier in 
   the called subprogram Procedure Division is replaced by a reference to the 
   corresponding USING identifier in the calling program. 
<p>
   If the reference to the corresponding data item in the CALL statement 
   declares the parameter to be passed BY CONTENT, the value of the item is 
   moved when the CALL statement is executed and placed into a system-defined 
 | storage item possessing the attributes declared for data-name-1 in the 
 | calling program.  The data description of each parameter in the BY CONTENT 
   phrase of the CALL statement must be the same, meaning no conversion or 
   extension or truncation, as the data description of the corresponding 
   parameter in the USING phrase of the Procedure Division header.

<A NAME=2.8.2><H2> 2.8.2   Declaratives</H2></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   Declaratives provide one or more special-purpose sections that are 
   executed when an exceptional condition occurs. 
<p>
   When Declarative Sections are specified, they must be grouped at the 
   beginning of the Procedure Division, and the entire Procedure Division 
   must be divided into sections. 
<p>
   Each Declarative Section starts with a USE statement that identifies the 
   section's function; the series of procedures that follow specify what 
   actions are to be taken when the exceptional condition occurs.  Each 
   Declarative Section ends with another section-name followed by a USE 
   statement, or with the keywords END DECLARATIVES.  For more information on 
   the USE statement, see <A HREF=#4.15>&quot;USE Statement&quot; in topic 4.15</A>. 
<p>
 | The entire group of Declarative Sections is preceded by the keyword 
 | DECLARATIVES written on the line after the Procedure Division header; the 
   group is followed by the keywords END DECLARATIVES.  The keywords 
   DECLARATIVES and END DECLARATIVES must each begin in Area A and be 
   followed by a separator period.  No other text can appear on the same 
   line. 
<p>
   In the declaratives part of the Procedure Division, each section header 
   must be followed by a separator period, and must be followed by a USE 
   statement, followed by a separator period.  No other text can appear on 
   the same line. 
<p>
   The USE statement itself is never executed; instead, the USE statement 
   defines the conditions that execute the succeeding procedural paragraphs, 
   which specify the actions to be taken.  After the procedure is executed, 
   control is returned to the routine that activated it. 
<p>
   Within a declarative procedure, except for the USE statement itself, there 
   must be no reference to any nondeclarative procedure. 
<p>
   Within a declarative procedure, no statement should be included that would 
   cause the execution of a USE procedure that had been previously invoked 
   and had not yet returned control to the invoking routine. 
<p>
 x You can include a statement that executes a previously invoked USE 
 x procedure that is still in control.  However, to avoid an infinite loop, 
 x you must be sure there is an eventual exit at the bottom. 
<p>
   The declarative procedure is exited when the last statement in the 
   procedure is executed.

<A NAME=2.8.4><H2> 2.8.4   Arithmetic Expressions</H2></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   Arithmetic expressions are used as operands of certain conditional and 
   arithmetic statements. 
<p>
   An arithmetic expression can consist of any of the following: 
<p>
 | 1.  An identifier described as a numeric elementary item 
<p>
 | 2.  A numeric literal (including the figurative constant ZERO) 
<p>
 | 3.  Identifiers and literals, separated by arithmetic operators 
<p>
 | 4.  An arithmetic expression, enclosed in parentheses 
<p>
 | 5.  Two arithmetic expressions, separated by an arithmetic operator. 
<p>
   Any arithmetic expression can be preceded by a unary operator. 
<p>
   Identifiers and literals appearing in arithmetic expressions must 
   represent either numeric elementary items or numeric literals on which 
   arithmetic can be performed. 
<p>
 | If an exponential expression can be evaluated as both a positive and 
 | negative number, the result will always be the positive number.  For 
 | example, the square root of 4, (expressed as 4 ** 0.5) can be evaluated as

   Five binary arithmetic operators and two unary arithmetic operators

   |__________|_________________________|__________|________________________| 
<p>
   <B>Note:</B>  Exponents in fixed-point exponential expressions cannot contain 
   more than 9 digits.  The compiler will truncate any exponent with more 
   than 9 digits.  In this case, the compiler will issue a diagnostic message 
   if the exponent is a literal or constant; if the exponent is a variable or 
   data-name, a diagnostic is issued at run-time. 
<p>
   Parentheses can be used in arithmetic expressions to specify the order in 
 | which elements are to be evaluated.  They can also be used to improve 
 | readability in cases where they do not affect the order of evaluation. 
<p>
   Expressions within parentheses are evaluated first.  When expressions are 
   contained within a nest of parentheses, evaluation proceeds from the 
 | innermost (least inclusive) to the outermost (most inclusive) set. 
<p>
   When parentheses are not used, or parenthesized expressions are at the 
   same level of inclusiveness, the following hierarchic order is implied: 
<p>
   1.  Unary operator 
   2.  Exponentiation 
   3.  Multiplication and division 
   4.  Addition and subtraction. 
<p>
   When the order of consecutive operations at the same hierarchic level is 
   not completely specified by parentheses, the order is from left to right. 
<p>
 | Following are some examples of how the use of parentheses affects the 
 | order of evaluation in arithmetic expressions: 
<p>
 |        <samp>8</samp> <samp>-</samp>  <samp>3</samp> <samp>-</samp> <samp>2</samp>  <samp>=</samp>  <samp>3</samp>

 |       <samp>24</samp> <samp>/</samp>  <samp>4</samp> <samp>/</samp> <samp>2</samp>  <samp>=</samp>  <samp>3</samp> 
 |       <samp>24</samp> <samp>/</samp> <samp>(4</samp> <samp>/</samp> <samp>2)</samp> <samp>=</samp> <samp>12</samp>

 |       <samp>-(2</samp> <samp>**</samp> <samp>2)</samp>    <samp>=</samp> <samp>-4</samp> 
<p>
   An arithmetic expression can begin only with a left parenthesis, a unary 
   operator, or an operand (that is, an identifier or a literal).  It can end 
   only with a right parenthesis or an operand.  An arithmetic expression 
   must contain at least one reference to an identifier or a literal. 
<p>
   There must be a one-to-one correspondence between left and right 
   parentheses in an arithmetic expression, with each left parenthesis placed 
   to the left of its corresponding right parenthesis. 
<p>
   Table 15 shows permissible arithmetic symbol pairs.  An arithmetic symbol 
   pair is the combination of two such symbols in sequence.  In the figure: 
<p>
   Yes   indicates a permissible pairing. 
   No    indicates that the pairing is not permitted.

       without an operational sign. 
<p>
       If its PICTURE does not contain an operational sign, the identifier 
       being tested is determined to be numeric only if the contents are 
       numeric and an operational sign is not present. 
<p>
       If its PICTURE does contain an operational sign, the identifier being 
       tested is determined to be numeric only if the item is an elementary 
       item, the contents are numeric, and a valid operational sign is

<p>
       The NUMERIC test cannot be used with an identifier described as 
       alphabetic or as a group item that contains one or more signed 
       elementary items. 
<p>
       For numeric data items, the identifier being tested must be described 
       implicitly or explicitly as USAGE DISPLAY. 
<p>
 x     For numeric data items, the identifier being tested can be described 
 x     as USAGE COMPUTATIONAL-3 or USAGE PACKED-DECIMAL. 
<p>
   <kbd>ALPHABETIC</kbd> 
 |     Identifier-1 consists entirely of any combination of the lowercase or

       definition of class-name in the SPECIAL-NAMES paragraph. 
<p>
       The class-name test must not be used with an identifier described as 
       numeric. 
<p>
 x <kbd>DBCS</kbd> 
 x     Identifier-1 consists entirely of double-byte characters. 
<p>
 x     The following rules apply: 
<p>
 x     o   The DBCS identifier being tested must be explicitly described as 
 x         USAGE DISPLAY-1.  Each byte of the identifier being tested can 
 x         contain characters that range in value from X'00' through X'FF'. 
<p>
 x     o   A range check is performed on the data portion of the item for 
 x         valid DBCS character representation.  The valid range is X'41' 
 x         through X'FE' for both bytes of each DBCS character and X'4040' 
 x         for the DBCS blank.

 x         characters that range in value from X'00' through X'FF'. 
<p>
 x     o   A range check is performed on the data portion of the item for 
 x         valid KANJI character representation.  The valid range is from 
 x         X'41' through X'7F' for the first byte, from X'41' through X'FE' 
 x         for the second byte, and X'4040' for the DBCS blank. 
<p>
   The class test is not valid for items defined as USAGE IS INDEX, as these 
   items do not belong to any class or category. 
<p>
 x The class test is not valid for items defined as USAGE IS POINTER, as 
 x these items do not belong to any class or category. 
<p>
 x The class condition cannot be used for external floating-point (USAGE

   |__________________________________|

   A condition-name is used in conditions as an abbreviation for the relation 
   condition.  The rules for comparing a conditional variable with a 
   condition-name value are the same as those specified for relation 
   conditions. 
<p>
   If the condition-name has been associated with a range of values (or with 
   several ranges of values), the conditional variable is tested to determine 
   whether or not its value falls within the range(s), including the end 
   values.  The result of the test is true if one of the values corresponding 
   to the condition-name equals the value of its associated conditional 
   variable. 
<p>
 x Condition-names with DBCS and floating-point are allowed. 
<p>
   The following example illustrates the use of conditional variables and 
   condition-names: 
<p>
<p>
     <samp>01</samp>  <samp>AGE-GROUP</samp>            <samp>PIC</samp>  <samp>99.</samp>

<p>
<p>
<p>
   AGE-GROUP is the conditional variable; INFANT, BABY, CHILD, and TEEN-AGER 
   are condition-names.  For individual records in the file, only one of the 
   values specified in the condition-name entries can be present. 
<p>
   The following IF statements can be added to the above example to determine 
   the age group of a specific record: 
<p>
<p>
     <samp>IF</samp> <samp>INFANT...</samp>             <samp>(Tests</samp> <samp>for</samp> <samp>value</samp> <samp>0)</samp>

   Depending on the evaluation of the condition-name condition, alternative 
   paths of execution are taken by the object program.

<p>
 | Comparisons of nonnumeric operands are made with respect to the collating 
 | sequence of the character set in use, according to the following rules: 
<p>
   o   For the EBCDIC character set, the EBCDIC collating sequence is used. 
<p>
   o   For the ASCII character set, the ASCII collating sequence is used. 
       (See <A HREF=#A.1.2>Appendix B, &quot;EBCDIC and ASCII Collating Sequences&quot; in</A> 
       <A HREF=#A.1.2>topic APPENDIX1.2</A>.) 
<p>
   o   When the PROGRAM COLLATING SEQUENCE clause is specified in the 
       OBJECT-COMPUTER paragraph, the collating sequence associated with the 
       alphabet-name clause in the SPECIAL-NAMES paragraph is used. 
<p>
   The size of each operand is the total number of characters in that 
   operand; the size affects the result of the comparison.  There are two 
   cases to consider: 
<p>
<p>
   <I>Operands</I> <I>of</I> <I>Equal</I> <I>Size</I> 
<p>
   o   Characters in corresponding positions of the two operands are 
       compared, beginning with the leftmost character and continuing through 
       the rightmost character. 
<p>
   o   If all pairs of characters through the last pair test as equal, the 
       operands are considered as equal. 
<p>
   o   If a pair of unequal characters is encountered, the characters are 
       tested to determine their relative positions in the collating 
       sequence.  The operand containing the character higher in the sequence 
       is considered the greater operand. 
<p>
<p>
   <I>Operands</I> <I>of</I> <I>Unequal</I> <I>Size</I> 
<p>
   o   If the operands are of unequal size, the comparison is made as though 
       the shorter operand were extended to the right with enough spaces to 
       make the operands equal in size. 
<p>
   Table 19 summarizes permissible comparisons with <B>nonnumeric</B> operands.

   The nonnumeric comparison rules discussed above apply.  In addition, when 
   numeric and nonnumeric operands are being compared, their USAGE must be 
   the same.  In such comparisons: 
<p>
   o   The numeric operand must be described as an integer literal or data 
       item. 
   o   Non-integer literals and data items must not be compared with 
       nonnumeric operands. 
 x o   External floating-point items can be compared with nonnumeric 
 x     operands. 
<p>
   If either of the operands is a group item, the nonnumeric comparison rules 
   discussed above apply.  In addition to those rules: 
<p>
   o   If the nonnumeric operand is a <B>literal</B> <B>or</B> <B>an</B> <B>elementary</B> <B>data</B> <B>item</B>, the 
       numeric operand is treated as though it were moved to an alphanumeric 
       elementary data item of the same size, and the contents of this 
       alphanumeric data item were then compared with the nonnumeric operand. 
<p>
   o   If the nonnumeric operand is a <B>group</B> <B>item</B>, the numeric operand is 
       treated as though it were moved to a group item of the same size, and 
       the contents of this group item were compared then with the nonnumeric

   <I>Order</I> <I>of</I> <I>Evaluation</I> <I>of</I> <I>Conditions</I>:  Parentheses, both explicit and 
   implicit, define the level of inclusiveness within a complex condition. 
   Two or more conditions connected by only the logical operators AND or OR 
   at the same level of inclusiveness establish a hierarchical level within a 
   complex condition.  An entire complex condition, therefore, is a nested 
   structure of hierarchical levels with the entire complex condition being 
   the most inclusive hierarchical level. 
<p>
   Within this context, the evaluation of the conditions within an entire 
   complex condition begins at the left of the condition.  The constituent 
   connected conditions within a hierarchical level are evaluated in order 
   from left to right, and evaluation of that hierarchical level terminates 
   as soon as a truth value for it is determined, regardless of whether all 
   the constituent connected conditions within that hierarchical level have 
   been evaluated. 
<p>
   Values are established for arithmetic expressions if and when the 
   conditions containing them are evaluated.  Similarly, negated conditions 
   are evaluated if and when it is necessary to evaluate the complex 
   condition that they represent. 
<p>
   For example: 
<p>
     <samp>NOT</samp> <samp>A</samp> <samp>IS</samp> <samp>GREATER</samp> <samp>THAN</samp> <samp>B</samp> <samp>OR</samp> <samp>A</samp> <samp>+</samp> <samp>B</samp> <samp>IS</samp> <samp>EQUAL</samp> <samp>TO</samp> <samp>C</samp> <samp>AND</samp> <samp>D</samp> <samp>IS</samp> <samp>POSITIVE</samp> 
<p>
   is evaluated as if parenthesized as follows:

     <samp>(NOT</samp> <samp>(A</samp> <samp>IS</samp> <samp>GREATER</samp> <samp>THAN</samp> <samp>B))</samp> <samp>OR</samp>

   In any consecutive sequence of relation-conditions, both forms of 
   abbreviation can be specified.  The abbreviated condition is evaluated as 
   if: 
<p>
   1.  The last stated subject is the missing subject. 
   2.  The last stated relational operator is the missing relational 
       operator. 
<p>
<p>
   The resulting combined condition must comply with the rules for element 
   sequence in combined conditions, as shown in <A HREF=#2.8.5.10>Table 22 in topic 2.8.5.10</A>. 
<p>
   If the word immediately following NOT is GREATER THAN, &gt;, LESS THAN, &lt;, 
   EQUAL TO, and =, then the NOT participates as part of the relational 
   operator. 
<p>
 | NOT in any other position in which it is legal is considered a logical 
   operator (and thus results in a negated relation-condition). 
<p>
<p>
 x <I>Using</I> <I>Parentheses</I> <I>in</I> <I>Abbreviated</I> <I>Combined</I> <I>Relation</I> <I>Conditions</I>:  You can 
 x use parentheses in combined relation conditions to specify an intended 
 x order of evaluation.  Using parentheses can also help you to improve the 
 x readability of conditional expressions. 
<p>
 x The following rules govern the use of parentheses in abbreviated combined 
 x relation conditions: 
<p>
 x 1.  Parentheses can be used to change the order of evaluation of the 
 x     logical operators AND and OR. 
<p>
 x 2.  The word NOT participates as part of the relational operator when it 
 x     is immediately followed by GREATER THAN, &gt;, LESS THAN, &lt;, EQUAL TO, 
 x     and =. 
<p>
 x 3.  NOT in any other position is considered a logical operator and thus 
 x     results in a negated relation-condition.  If you use NOT as a logical 
 x     operator, only the relation condition immediately following the NOT is 
 x     negated; the negation is not propagated through the abbreviated 
 x     combined relation condition along with the subject and relational 
 x     operator. 
<p>
 x 4.  The logical NOT operator can appear within a parenthetical expression 
 x     that immediately follows a relational operator. 
<p>
 x 5.  When a left parenthesis appears immediately after the relational 
 x     operator, the relational operator is distributed to all objects 
 x     enclosed in the parentheses.  In the case of a &quot;distributed&quot; 
 x     relational operator, the subject and relational operator remain 
 x     current after the right parenthesis which ends the distribution.  The 
 x     following three restrictions apply to cases where the relational 
 x     operator is distributed throughout the expression: 
<p>
 x     a.  A simple condition cannot appear within the scope of the 
 x         distribution. 
 x     b.  Another relational operator cannot appear within the scope of the 
 x         distribution. 
 x     c.  The logical operator NOT cannot appear immediately after the left 
 x         parenthesis, which defines the scope of the distribution. 
<p>
 x 6.  Evaluation proceeds from the least to the most inclusive condition. 
<p>
 x 7.  There must be a one-to-one correspondence between left and right 
 x     parentheses, with each left parenthesis to the left of its 
 x     corresponding right parenthesis.  If the parentheses are unbalanced, 
 x     the compiler inserts a parenthesis and issues an E-level message. 
 x     Note, however, that if the compiler-inserted parenthesis results in 
 x     the truncation of the expression, you will receive an S-level 
 x     diagnostic message. 
<p>
 x 8.  The last stated subject is inserted in place of the missing subject. 
<p>
 x 9.  The last stated relational operator is inserted in place of the 
 x     missing relational operator. 
<p>
 x 10. Insertion of the omitted subject and/or relational operator ends when: 
<p>
 x     a.  Another simple condition is encountered, 
 x     b.  A condition-name is encountered, 
 x     c.  A right parenthesis is encountered that matches a left parenthesis 
 x         that appears to the left of the subject. 
<p>
 x 11. In any consecutive sequence of relation conditions, you can use both 
 x     abbreviated relation conditions that contain parentheses and those 
 x     that don't. 
<p>
 x 12. Consecutive logical NOT operators cancel each other and result in an 
 x     S-level message.  Note, however, that an abbreviated combined relation 
 x     condition can contain two consecutive NOT operators when the second 
 x     NOT is part of a relational operator.  For example, you can abbreviate 
 x     the first condition as the second condition listed below. 
<p>
 x       <samp>A</samp> <samp>=</samp> <samp>B</samp> <samp>and</samp> <samp>not</samp> <samp>A</samp> <samp>not</samp> <samp>=</samp> <samp>C</samp>

   explicit scope terminator (see <A HREF=#2.8.6.3>&quot;Delimited Scope Statements&quot; in</A> 
   <A HREF=#2.8.6.3>topic 2.8.6.3</A>).  A series of imperative statements can be specified

<p>
   A <B>conditional</B> <B>statement</B> specifies that the truth value of a condition is 
   to be determined, and that the subsequent action of the object program is 
   dependent on this truth value.  (See <A HREF=#2.8.5>&quot;Conditional Expressions&quot; in</A> 
   <A HREF=#2.8.5>topic 2.8.5</A>.)  Table 27 lists COBOL statements that become conditional 
   when a <B>condition</B> (for example, ON SIZE ERROR or ON OVERFLOW) is included, 
   and when the statement is not terminated by its explicit scope terminator.

<p>
   In general, a delimited scope statement uses an explicit scope terminator 
   to turn a conditional statement into an imperative statement; the 
   resulting imperative statement can then be nested.  Explicit scope 
   terminators can also be used, however, to terminate the scope of an 
   imperative statement.  Explicit scope terminators are provided for all 
   COBOL verbs that can have conditional phrases. 
<p>
   Unless explicitly specified otherwise, a delimited scope statement can be 
   specified wherever an imperative statement is allowed by the rules of the 
   language.

   An explicit scope terminator marks the end of certain Procedure Division 
   statements.  A conditional statement that is delimited by its explicit 
   scope terminator is considered an imperative statement and must follow the 
   rules for imperative statements.

<A NAME=2.8.7.1><H3> 2.8.7.1   CORRESPONDING Phrase</H3></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   The CORRESPONDING (CORR) phrase allows ADD, SUBTRACT, and MOVE operations 
   to be performed on elementary data items of the same name if the group 
   items to which they belong are specified. 
<p>
   Both identifiers following the keyword CORRESPONDING must name group 
   items.  In this discussion, these identifiers are referred to as 
   identifier-1 and identifier-2. 
<p>
   A pair of data items (subordinate items), one from identifier-1 and one 
   from identifier-2, correspond if the following conditions are true: 
<p>
   o   In an ADD or SUBTRACT statement, both of the data items are elementary 
       numeric data items.  Other data items are ignored. 
<p>
   o   In a MOVE statement, at least one of the data items is an elementary 
       item, and the move is permitted by the move rules. 
<p>
   o   The two subordinate items have the same name and the same qualifiers 
       up to but not including identifier-1 and identifier-2. 
<p>
   o   The subordinate items are not identified by the keyword FILLER. 
<p>
   o   Neither identifier-1 nor identifier-2 is described as a level 66, 77, 
       or 88 item, nor is either described as a USAGE IS INDEX item.  Neither 
       identifier-1 nor identifier-2 can be reference-modified. 
<p>
   o   The subordinate items do not include a REDEFINES, RENAMES, OCCURS, or 
       USAGE IS INDEX clause in their descriptions. 
<p>
       However, identifier-1 and identifier-2 themselves can contain or be 
       subordinate to items containing a REDEFINES or OCCURS clause in their 
       descriptions. 
<p>
 x o   Neither identifier-1 nor identifier-2 nor the two subordinate items 
 x     are described as USAGE IS POINTER items. 
<p>
 x o   Identifier-1 and/or identifier-2 can be subordinate to a FILLER item. 
<p>
   For example, if two data hierarchies are defined as follows: 
<p>
 |   <samp>05</samp>  <samp>ITEM-1</samp>    <samp>OCCURS</samp> <samp>6</samp> <samp>TIMES</samp>  <samp>INDEXED</samp> <samp>BY</samp> <samp>X.</samp> 
       <samp>10</samp>  <samp>ITEM-A</samp>  <samp>PIC</samp> <samp>S9(3).</samp> 
       <samp>10</samp>  <samp>ITEM-B</samp>  <samp>PIC</samp> <samp>+99.9.</samp> 
       <samp>10</samp>  <samp>ITEM-C</samp>  <samp>PIC</samp> <samp>X(4).</samp> 
       <samp>10</samp>  <samp>ITEM-D</samp>  <samp>REDEFINES</samp> <samp>ITEM-C</samp>  <samp>PIC</samp> <samp>9(4).</samp> 
       <samp>10</samp>  <samp>ITEM-E</samp>  <samp>USAGE</samp> <samp>COMP-1.</samp> 
       <samp>10</samp>  <samp>ITEM-F</samp>  <samp>USAGE</samp> <samp>INDEX.</samp> 
     <samp>05</samp>  <samp>ITEM-2.</samp> 
       <samp>10</samp>  <samp>ITEM-A</samp>  <samp>PIC</samp> <samp>99.</samp> 
       <samp>10</samp>  <samp>ITEM-B</samp>  <samp>PIC</samp> <samp>+9V9.</samp> 
       <samp>10</samp>  <samp>ITEM-C</samp>  <samp>PIC</samp> <samp>A(4).</samp> 
       <samp>10</samp>  <samp>ITEM-D</samp>  <samp>PIC</samp> <samp>9(4).</samp> 
       <samp>10</samp>  <samp>ITEM-E</samp>  <samp>PIC</samp> <samp>9(9)</samp>  <samp>USAGE</samp> <samp>COMP.</samp> 
       <samp>10</samp>  <samp>ITEM-F</samp>  <samp>USAGE</samp> <samp>INDEX.</samp> 
<p>
   Then, if ADD CORR ITEM-2 TO ITEM-1(X) is specified, ITEM-A and ITEM-A(X), 
   ITEM-B and ITEM-B(X), and ITEM-E and ITEM-E(X) are considered to be 
   corresponding and are added together.  ITEM-C and ITEM-C(X) are not 
   included because they are not numeric.  ITEM-D and ITEM-D(X) are not 
   included because ITEM-D(X) includes a REDEFINES clause in its data 
   description.  ITEM-F and ITEM-F(X) are not included because they are 
   defined as USAGE IS INDEX.  Note that ITEM-1 is valid as either 
   identifier-1 or identifier-2. 
<p>
   If any of the individual operations in the ADD CORRESPONDING statement 
   produces a size error condition, imperative-statement-1 in the ON SIZE 
   ERROR phrase is not executed until all of the individual additions are 
   completed.

</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   After decimal point alignment, the number of places in the fraction of the 
   result of an arithmetic operation is compared with the number of places 
   provided for the fraction of the resultant identifier. 
<p>
   When the size of the fractional result exceeds the number of places 
   provided for its storage, truncation occurs unless ROUNDED is specified. 
   When ROUNDED is specified, the least significant digit of the resultant 
   identifier is increased by 1 whenever the most significant digit of the 
   excess is greater than or equal to 5. 
<p>
   When the resultant identifier is described by a PICTURE clause containing 
   rightmost Ps, and when the number of places in the calculated result 
   exceeds the number of integer positions specified, rounding or truncation 
   occurs, relative to the rightmost integer position for which storage is 
   allocated.

   A size error condition can occur in three different ways:

   | fractional power      | executed.              | a message is issued.  | 
   |_______________________|________________________|_______________________| 
<p>
   The size error condition applies only to final results, not to any 
   intermediate results. 
<p>
   If the resultant identifier is defined with USAGE IS BINARY, 
 x COMPUTATIONAL, or COMPUTATIONAL-4, the largest value that can be contained 
   in it is the maximum value implied by its associated decimal PICTURE 
   character-string. 
<p>
   If the ROUNDED phrase is specified, rounding takes place before size error 
   checking. 
<p>
   When a size error occurs, the subsequent action of the program depends on 
   whether or not the ON SIZE ERROR phrase is specified. 
<p>
 | If the ON SIZE ERROR phrase <B>is</B> <B>not</B> specified and a size error condition 
 | exists after the execution of the arithmetic operations specified by an 
 | arithmetic statement, the values of the affected resultant identifiers are 
 | undefined.  After completion of the arithmetic operations, control is 
 | transferred to the end of the arithmetic statement and the NOT ON SIZE 
 | ERROR phrase, if specified, is ignored. 
<p>
   If the ON SIZE ERROR phrase <B>is</B> specified and a size error condition 
   occurs, the value of the resultant identifier affected by the size error 
   is not altered--that is, the error results are not placed in the receiving 
   identifier.  After completion of the execution of the arithmetic 
   operation, the imperative statement in the ON SIZE ERROR phrase is 
   executed, control is transferred to the end of the arithmetic statement, 
   and the NOT ON SIZE ERROR phrase, if specified, is ignored. 
<p>
   For ADD CORRESPONDING and SUBTRACT CORRESPONDING statements, if an 
   individual arithmetic operation causes a size error condition, the ON SIZE 
   ERROR imperative statement is not executed until all the individual 
   additions or subtractions have been completed. 
<p>
   If the NOT ON SIZE ERROR phrase has been specified and, after execution of 
   an arithmetic operation, a size error condition does not exist, the NOT ON 
   SIZE ERROR phrase is executed. 
<p>
   When both ON SIZE ERROR and NOT ON SIZE ERROR phrases are specified, and 
   the statement in the phrase that is executed does not contain any explicit 
   transfer of control, then, if necessary, an implicit transfer of control 
   is made after execution of the phrase to the end of the arithmetic 
   statement.

   The maximum size of each operand is 18 decimal digits.  The <B>composite</B> <B>of</B> 
   <B>operands</B> is a hypothetical data item resulting from aligning the operands 
   at the decimal point and then superimposing them on one another.  It must 
   not contain more than 18 decimal digits. 
<p>
 | For example, assume that each item is defined as follows in the Data

       considered to be written in the same left-to-right order as the 
       multiple results are listed. 
<p>
<p>
   For example, executing the following statement: 
<p>
     <samp>ADD</samp> <samp>A,</samp> <samp>B,</samp> <samp>C,</samp> <samp>TO</samp> <samp>C,</samp> <samp>D(C),</samp> <samp>E.</samp> 
<p>
   is equivalent to executing the following series of statements: 
<p>
     <samp>ADD</samp> <samp>A,</samp> <samp>B,</samp> <samp>C</samp> <samp>GIVING</samp> <samp>TEMP.</samp> 
     <samp>ADD</samp> <samp>TEMP</samp> <samp>TO</samp> <samp>C.</samp> 
     <samp>ADD</samp> <samp>TEMP</samp> <samp>TO</samp> <samp>D(C).</samp> 
     <samp>ADD</samp> <samp>TEMP</samp> <samp>TO</samp> <samp>E.</samp> 
<p>
   In the above example, TEMP is a compiler-supplied temporary result field. 
   When the addition operation for D(C) is performed, the subscript C 
   contains the new value of C.

<p>
   COBOL input-output statements transfer data to and from files stored on 
   external media, and also control low-volume data that is obtained from or 
   sent to an input/output device. 
<p>
   In COBOL, the unit of file data made available to the program is a record, 
   and you need only be concerned with such records.  Provision is 
   automatically made for such operations as the movement of data into 
   buffers and/or internal storage, validity checking, error correction 
   (where feasible), blocking and deblocking, and volume switching 
   procedures. 
<p>
   The description of the file in the Environment Division and Data Division 
   governs which input-output statements are allowed in the Procedure 
   Division.  Permissible statements for each type of file organization are 
   shown in <A HREF=#3.24.4>Table 37 in topic 3.24.4 </A>and <A HREF=#3.24.4>Table 38 in topic 3.24.4</A>. 
<p>
   Discussions in the following section use the terms <B>volume</B> and <B>reel</B>.  The 
   term <B>volume</B> refers to all non-unit-record input-output devices.  The term 
   <B>reel</B> applies only to tape devices.  Treatment of direct access devices in 
   the sequential access mode is logically equivalent to the treatment of 
   tape devices.

<p>
   If the FILE STATUS clause is specified in the FILE-CONTROL entry, a value 
   is placed in the specified status key during execution of any request on 
   that file; the value indicates the status of that request.  The value is 
   placed in the status key before execution of any EXCEPTION/ERROR 
   declarative or INVALID KEY/AT END phrase associated with the request. 
<p>
 | There are two status key data items.  One is for QSAM, SAM, or VSAM files, 
 | and it is described by data-name-1 in the FILE STATUS clause of the 
 | FILE-CONTROL entry.  This is a 2-character data item with the first 
 | character known as status key 1 and the second character known as status 
 | key 2.  The combinations of possible values and their meanings are shown 
 | in Table 30. 
<p>
 x The other status key data item is for VSAM files only, and it is described 
 x by data-name-8 in the FILE STATUS clause of the FILE-CONTROL entry.  For 
 x more information on the VSAM file status key, see <A HREF=#2.4.13>&quot;FILE STATUS Clause&quot; in</A>

<A NAME=2.8.9.1.2><H4>| 2.8.9.1.2   Invalid Key Condition</H4></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   The invalid key condition can occur during execution of a START, READ, 
   WRITE, REWRITE, or DELETE statement.  (For details of the causes for the 
   condition, see the appropriate statement in <A HREF=#3.0>&quot;Part 3.  Procedure Division</A> 
   <A HREF=#3.0>Statements&quot; in topic 3.0</A>.)  When an invalid key condition occurs, the 
   input-output statement that caused the condition is unsuccessful. 
<p>
   When the invalid key condition is recognized, actions are taken in the 
   following order: 
<p>
   1.  If the FILE STATUS clause is specified in the FILE-CONTROL entry, a 
       value is placed into the status key to indicate an invalid key 
       condition.  (See <A HREF=#2.8.9.1.1>Table 30 in topic 2.8.9.1.1</A>.) 
<p>
   2.  If the INVALID KEY phrase is specified in the statement causing the 
       condition, control is transferred to the INVALID KEY 
       imperative-statement.  Any EXCEPTION/ERROR declarative procedure 
       specified for this file is not executed.  Execution then continues 
       according to the rules for each statement specified in the 
       imperative-statement. 
<p>
   3.  If the INVALID KEY phrase is not specified in the input-output 
       statement for a file, an EXCEPTION/ERROR procedure <B>must</B> be specified, 
       and that procedure is executed.  The NOT INVALID KEY phrase, if 
       specified, is ignored. 
<p>
 x Both the INVALID KEY phrase and the EXCEPTION/ERROR procedure can be 
 x omitted. 
<p>
   If the invalid key condition does not exist after execution of the 
   input-output operation, the INVALID KEY phrase is ignored, if specified, 
   and the following actions are taken: 
<p>
   1.  If an exception condition which is not an invalid key condition 
       exists, control is transferred according to the rules of the USE 
       statement following the execution of any USE AFTER EXCEPTION 
       procedure. 
<p>
   2.  If no exception condition exists, control is transferred to the end of 
       the input-output statement or the imperative statement specified in 
       the NOT INVALID KEY phrase, if it is specified.

   o   The INTO phrase can be specified in a READ or RETURN statement. 
<p>
       The result of the execution of a READ or RETURN statement with the 
       INTO phrase is equivalent to the application of the following rules in 
       the order specified: 
<p>
       -   The execution of the same READ or RETURN statement without the 
           INTO phrase. 
<p>
       -   The current record is moved from the record area to the area 
           specified by identifier-1 according to the rules for the MOVE 
           statement without the CORRESPONDING phrase.  The size of the 
           current record is determined by rules specified in the RECORD 
           clause.  If the file description entry contains a RECORD IS 
           VARYING clause, the implied move is a group move.  The implied 
           MOVE statement does not occur if the execution of the READ or 
           RETURN statement was unsuccessful.  Any subscripting or 
           reference-modification associated with identifier-1 is evaluated 
           after the record has been read or returned and immediately before 
           it is moved to the data item.  The record is available in both the 
           record area and the data item referenced by identifier-1. 
<p>
   o   The FROM phrase can be specified in a RELEASE, REWRITE, or WRITE 
       statement. 
<p>
       The result of the execution of a RELEASE, REWRITE, or WRITE statement 
       with the FROM phrase is equivalent to the execution of the following 
       statements in the order specified: 
<p>
             <samp>MOVE</samp> <samp>identifier-1</samp> <samp>TO</samp> <samp>record-name-1</samp> 
<p>
       The same RELEASE, REWRITE, or WRITE statement without the FROM phrase. 
<p>
       After the execution of the RELEASE, REWRITE or WRITE statement is 
       complete, the information in the area referenced by identifier-1 is 
       available, even though the information in the area referenced by 
       record-name-1 is not available, except specified by the SAME RECORD 
       AREA clause.

   Format 1 transfers data from an input/output device into identifier-1. 
   When the FROM phrase is omitted, the system input device is assumed. 
<p>
   Format 1 is useful for exceptional situations in a program when operator 
   intervention (to supply a given message, code, or exception indicator) is 
   required.  The operator must, of course, be supplied with the appropriate 
   messages with which to reply. 
<p>
   <kbd>identifier-1</kbd> 
       Can be any group item, or an elementary alphabetic, alphanumeric, 
       alphanumeric-edited, numeric-edited or external decimal item. 
<p>
 x     It can also be a DBCS data item or an external floating-point item. 
<p>
   <kbd>mnemonic-name-1</kbd> 
       Must be associated in the SPECIAL-NAMES paragraph with an input/output 
       device:  either a system input device or a console typewriter.  For 
       more information on acceptable values for mnemonic-name-1, see 
       <A HREF=#2.3.3>&quot;SPECIAL-NAMES Paragraph&quot; in topic 2.3.3</A>. 
<p>
       o   System input device 
<p>
               The maximum logical record length allowed is 256 characters. 
<p>
               The system input device is read until identifier-1 is filled 
               or EOF is encountered.  If the length of identifier-1 is not 
               an even multiple of the system input device record length, the 
               final record will be truncated as required.  If EOF is 
               encountered after data has been moved, and before identifier-1 
               has been filled, identifier-1 is padded with blanks.  If EOF 
               is encountered before any data has been moved to identifier-1, 
               padding will not take place and identifier-1 contents will 
               remain unchanged.  Each input record is concatenated with the 
               previous input record. 
<p>
               If the input record is of the fixed-length format, the entire 
               input record is used.  No editing is performed to remove 
               trailing or leading blanks. 
<p>
               If the input record is of the variable-length format, the 
               actual record length is used to determine the amount of data 
               received.  With variable format records, the Record Definition 
               Word (RDW) is removed from the beginning of the input record. 
               Only the actual input data is transferred to identifier-1. 
<p>
<p>
       o   Console typewriter 
<p>
           1.  A system-generated message code is automatically displayed, 
               followed by the literal AWAITING REPLY.  The maximum length of 
               an input message is 114 characters. 
<p>
           2.  Execution is suspended. 
<p>
           3.  After the message code (the same code as in item 1) is entered 
               from the console and recognized by the system, ACCEPT 
               statement execution is resumed.  The message is moved to 
               identifier-1 and left-justified, regardless of its PICTURE 
<p>
               The ACCEPT statement is terminated after any of the following 
               occurs: 
<p>
               -   If no data is received from the console. For example, if 
                   the operator hits the ENTER key 
               -   The identifier is filled with data 
               -   Fewer than 114 characters of data are entered. 
<p>
               If 114 bytes of data are entered and the identifier is still 
               not filled with data, then more requests for data are issued 
               to the console.  If more than 114 characters of data are 
               entered, only the first 114 characters will be recognized by 
               the system. 
<p>
               If the identifier is longer than the incoming message, the 
               rightmost characters are padded with spaces.  If the incoming 
               message is longer than the identifier, the character positions 
               beyond the length of the identifier are truncated. 
<p>
 x <kbd>environment-name</kbd> 
 x     A valid <B>environment-name</B> can be specified in the FROM phrase.  See 
 x     <A HREF=#2.3.3>Table 6 in topic 2.3.3</A> for a list of valid environment-names. 
<p>
   <B>Note:</B>  If the device specified in an ACCEPT statement is the same device 
   used for READ statements, results are unpredictable.

   The ALTER statement modifies the GO TO statement in the paragraph named by 
   procedure-name-1.  Subsequent executions of the modified GO TO 
   statement(s) transfer control to procedure-name-2. 
<p>
   <kbd>procedure-name-1</kbd> 
       Must name a Procedure Division paragraph that contains only one 
       sentence:  a GO TO statement without the DEPENDING ON phrase. 
<p>
   <kbd>procedure-name-2</kbd> 
       Must name a Procedure Division section or paragraph. 
<p>
   Before the ALTER statement is executed, when control reaches the paragraph 
   specified in procedure-name-1, the GO TO statement transfers control to 
   the paragraph specified in the GO TO statement.  After execution of the 
   ALTER statement, however, the next time control reaches the paragraph 
   specified in procedure-name-1, the GO TO statement transfers control to 
   the paragraph specified in procedure-name-2. 
<p>
   The ALTER statement acts as a program switch, allowing, for example, one 
   sequence of execution during initialization and another sequence during 
   the bulk of file processing. 
<p>
   Altered GO TO statements in programs with the INITIAL attribute are 
   returned to their initial states each time the program is entered.

</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   A GO TO statement in a section whose priority is greater than or equal to 
   50 must not be referred to by an ALTER statement in a section with a 
   different priority.  All other uses of the ALTER statement are valid and 
   are performed, even if the GO TO to which the ALTER refers is in a fixed 
   overlayable segment. 
<p>
   Altered GO TO statements in independent segments are returned to their 
   initial states when control is transferred to the independent segment that 
   contains the ALTERED GO TO from another independent segment with a 
   different priority. 
<p>
   This transfer of control can take place because of: 
<p>
   o   The effect of previous statements 
   o   An explicit transfer of control with a PERFORM or GO TO statement 
   o   A sort or merge statement with the INPUT or OUTPUT phrase specified.

<p>
   An exception condition occurs when the called subprogram cannot be made 
   available.  At that time, one of the following two actions will occur: 
<p>
   1.  If the ON EXCEPTION phrase is specified in the CALL statement, control 
       is transferred to imperative-statement-1.  Execution then continues 
       according to the rules for each statement specified in 
       imperative-statement-1.  If a procedure branching or conditional 
       statement that causes explicit transfer of control is executed, 
       control is transferred in accordance with the rules for that 
       statement; otherwise, upon completion of the execution of 
       imperative-statement-1, control is transferred to the end of the CALL 
       statement and the NOT ON EXCEPTION phrase, if specified, is ignored. 
<p>
   2.  If the ON EXCEPTION phrase is not specified in the CALL statement, the 
       NOT ON EXCEPTION phrase, if specified, is ignored.

</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   More than one program in the run unit may have the same program-name, and 
   the reference in a CALL statement to such a program-name is resolved by 
   using the scope of names conventions for program-names (see <A HREF=#2.2.1.1>&quot;Scope of</A> 
   <A HREF=#2.2.1.1>Program-Names&quot; in topic 2.2.1.1</A>). 
<p>
   When only two programs in the run unit have the same name as that 
   specified in a CALL statement: 
<p>
   1.  One of those two programs must also be contained directly or 
       indirectly either within the separately compiled program that includes 
       that CALL statement or within the separately compiled program that 
       itself directly or indirectly contains the program that includes that 
       CALL statement, and 
<p>
   2.  The other of those two programs must be a different separately 
       compiled program. 
<p>
   The mechanism used is as follows: 
<p>
   1.  If a program has the same name as that specified in the CALL statement 
       is directly contained within the program that includes that CALL 
       statement, that program is called. 
<p>
   2.  If a program has the same name as that specified in the CALL statement 
       and possesses the COMMON attribute and is directly contained within 
       another program that directly or indirectly contains the program that 
       includes the CALL statement, that common program is called unless the 
       calling program is contained within that common program. 
<p>
   3.  Otherwise, the call is resolved to a separately-compiled program.

<pre width="80">
<p>
   In the static CALL statement, the COBOL program and all called programs 
   are part of the same load module.  When control is transferred to the 
   called program, it is already resident in storage, and a branch to the 
   called program takes place.  Subsequent executions of the CALL statement 
   make the called program available in its last-used state, unless the 
   called program has the INITIAL attribute.  If the called program possesses 
   the INITIAL attribute, it and each program directly or indirectly 
   contained within it is placed into its initial state every time the called 
   program is called within a run unit.

<A NAME=3.4.11><H3> 3.4.11   Dynamic CALL Statement</H3></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   In this form of the CALL statement, the called COBOL subprogram is not 
   link-edited with the main program, but is instead link-edited into a 
   separate load module, and, at run time, is loaded only if and when it is 
   required (that is, when called). 
<p>
   Each subprogram invoked with a dynamic CALL statement may be part of a 
   different load module that is a member of the system link library or of a 
   user-supplied private library.  The execution of the dynamic CALL 
   statement to a subprogram that is not resident in storage results in the 
   loading of that subprogram from secondary storage into the 
   region/partition containing the main program and a branch to the 
   subprogram. 
<p>
   Thus, the first dynamic CALL to a subprogram obtains a fresh copy of the 
   subprogram.  Subsequent calls to the same subprogram (by either the 
   original caller or by any other subprogram within the same 
   region/partition) result in a branch to the same copy of the subprogram in 
   its last-used state, provided the subprogram does not possess the INITIAL 
   attribute.  Thus, the reinitialization of either of the following items is 
   your responsibility: 
<p>
   o   GO TO statements that have been altered 
   o   Data items. 
<p>
   When a CANCEL statement is issued for a subprogram, the storage occupied 
   by the subprogram is freed, and a subsequent CALL to the subprogram will 
   function as though it were the first.  A CANCEL statement referring to a 
   called subprogram can be issued by a program other than the original 
   caller. 
<p>
 x If the called subprogram has more than one entry point, differing entry 
 x points must not be specified in the dynamic CALL statement until an 
 x intervening CANCEL statement has been executed.

   Processing begins in the <B>calling</B> program.  When the first CALL statement 
   is executed, control is transferred to the first statement of the 
   Procedure Division in <tt>SUBPROG</tt>, which is the <B>called</B> program. 
<p>
   In each of the CALL statements, the operand of the first USING option is 
   identified as <tt>RECORD-1</tt>. 
<p>
   When <tt>SUBPROG</tt> receives control, the values within <tt>RECORD-1</tt> are made 
   available to <tt>SUBPROG</tt>; however, in <tt>SUBPROG</tt> they are referred to as <tt>PAYREC</tt>. 
<p>
   The PICTURE character-strings within <tt>PAYREC</tt> and <tt>PAY-CODE</tt> contain the same 
   number of characters as <tt>RECORD-1</tt> and <tt>RECORD-2</tt>, although the descriptions 
   are not identical. 
<p>
   When processing within <tt>SUBPROG</tt> reaches the <tt>EXIT</tt> <tt>PROGRAM</tt> statement, control 
   is returned to the calling program.  Processing continues in that program 
   until the second CALL statement is issued. 
<p>
 x <B>Note:</B>  In a statically linked program, the CANCEL statement would not be 
 x valid. 
<p>
 x In the example of a dynamically-linked program, however, because the 
 x second CALL statement refers to another entry point within <tt>SUBPROG</tt>, a 
 x CANCEL statement is issued before the second CALL statement. 
<p>
 x With the second CALL statement in the calling program, control is again 
 x transferred to <tt>SUBPROG</tt>, but this time processing begins at the statement 
 x following the ENTRY statement in <tt>SUBPROG</tt>.  The values within <tt>RECORD-1</tt> are 
 | again made available to <tt>SUPPROG</tt>.  In addition, the value in <tt>RECORD-2</tt> is 
 x now made available to <tt>SUPPROG</tt> through the corresponding USING operand 
 x <tt>PAY-CODE</tt>.

 x When processing reaches the GOBACK statement, control is returned to the 
 x calling program at the statement immediately following the second CALL 
 x statement. 
<p>
 x When control is transferred the second time from the statically linked 
 x program, <tt>SUBPROG</tt> is made available in its last-used state (that is, if any 
 x values in <tt>SUBPROG</tt> storage were changed during the first execution, those 
 x changed values are still in effect).  When control is transferred from the 
 x dynamically linked program, however, <tt>SUBPROG</tt> is made available in its 
 x initial state. 
<p>
   In any given execution of these two programs, if the values within 
   <tt>RECORD-1</tt> are changed between the time of the first CALL and the second, 
   the values passed at the time of the second CALL statement will be the 
   changed, not the original, values.  If the user wants to use the original 
   values, they must be saved.

<pre width="80">
<p>
   Called subprograms that are invoked at object time by the dynamic CALL 
   statement must be members of the system link library or of a user-supplied 
   private library. 
<p>
   The static call statement results in the called subprogram being 
   link-edited with the main program into one load module.  Thus, the 
   program-name and the alternate entry point can be specified in any order 
   in the main program's CALL statements. 
<p>
   Static and dynamic CALL statements can both be specified in the same 
   program.  The CALL literal-1 statement results, in this case, in the 
   subprogram invoked being link-edited with the main program into one load 
   module.  The CALL identifier-1 statement results in the dynamic invocation 
   of a separate load module. 
<p>
   When a dynamic CALL statement and a static CALL statement to the same 
   subprogram are issued within one program, a second copy of the subprogram 
   is loaded into storage.  Because this doesn't guarantee that the 
   subprogram will be left in its last-used state, results may be 
   unpredictable. 
<p>
   <B>Note:</B>  Under MVS, linking two load modules together results logically in a 
   single program with a primary entry point and an alternate entry point, 
   each with its own name.  Each name by which a subprogram is to be 
   dynamically invoked must be known to the system.  Each such name must be 
   specified in linkage editor control statements as either a NAME or an 
   ALIAS of the load module containing the subprogram. 
<p>
   This does not apply to link-editing under VSE, however.  For information 
   about link-editing under VSE systems, see <cite>VS</cite> <cite>COBOL</cite> <cite>II</cite> <cite>Application</cite>

<A NAME=3.5><H2> 3.5   CANCEL Statement</H2></A>

<pre width="80">
<p>
   The CANCEL statement ensures that the next time the referenced subprogram 
   is called it will be entered in its initial state. 
<p>
<p>
    ___ <A NAME=cancel-statement>cancel-statement</A> ____________________

   |_________________________________________|

   <kbd>identifier-1,</kbd> <kbd>literal-1</kbd> 
 |     Identifier-1 must be an alphanumeric data item.  Literal-1 must be a 
 |     nonnumeric literal.  Literal-1 or identifier-1 must contain the 
 |     program-name specified in the PROGRAM-ID paragraph of the program 
 |     being canceled.  (See <A HREF=#2.2.1>&quot;PROGRAM-ID Paragraph&quot; in topic 2.2.1</A>.) 
<p>
 x     Identifier-1 can be an alphabetic or zoned decimal data item. 
<p>
       Each literal or contents of the identifier specified in the CANCEL 
       statement must be the same as the literal or contents of the 
       identifier specified in an associated CALL statement. 
<p>
   After a CANCEL statement for a called subprogram has been executed, that 
   subprogram no longer has a logical connection to the program.  The 
   contents of data items in external data records described by the 
   subprogram are not changed when that subprogram is canceled.  If a CALL 
   statement is executed later by any program in the run unit naming the same 
   subprogram, that subprogram will be entered in its initial state. 
<p>
   When a CANCEL statement is executed, all programs contained within the 
   program referenced by the CANCEL statement are also canceled.  The result 
   is the same as if a valid CANCEL were executed for each contained program 
   in the reverse order in which the programs appear in the separately 
   compiled program. 
<p>
   A CANCEL statement closes all open files that are associated with an 
   internal file connector in the program named in the explicit CANCEL 
   statement.  Any USE procedures associated with any of these files are not 
   executed. 
<p>
   You can cancel a called subprogram by referencing it as the operand of a 
   CANCEL statement, by terminating the run unit of which the subprogram is a 
 x member, or by executing an EXIT PROGRAM statement or GOBACK statement in 
   the called subprogram if that subprogram possesses the INITIAL attribute. 
<p>
   No action is taken when a CANCEL statement is executed, naming a program 
   that either: 
<p>
   1.  Has not been dynamically called in this run unit by another VS COBOL 
       II or OS/VS COBOL program. 
<p>
   2.  Has been called and subsequently canceled. 
<p>
   Called subprograms can contain CANCEL statements. However, a called 
   program must not execute a CANCEL statement that directly or indirectly 
   cancels the calling program itself, or any other program higher than 
   itself in the calling hierarchy.  In such a case, the run unit is 
   terminated. 
<p>
   A program named in a CANCEL statement must not refer to any program that 
 x has been called and has not yet executed an EXIT PROGRAM or a GOBACK 
   statement. 
<p>
   A program can, however, cancel a program that it did not call, providing 
   that, in the calling hierarchy, it is higher than or equal to the program 
   it is canceling. 
   For example: 
<p>
     <samp>A</samp> <samp>calls</samp> <samp>B</samp> <samp>and</samp> <samp>B</samp> <samp>calls</samp> <samp>C</samp>        <samp>(When</samp> <samp>A</samp> <samp>receives</samp> <samp>control,</samp>

   Whether a VSAM file is contained on a single volume or on multiple volumes 
   is of no concern.  Thus the concept of volumes has no meaning for these 
   types of files.  If an input VSAM file is described as SELECT OPTIONAL in 
   the FILE-CONTROL entry and the file is not present during this execution

   <kbd>identifier-1</kbd> 
       If it is numeric and is not described as an external decimal, then 
       identifier-1 is converted automatically to external format, as 
       follows: 
<p>
       o   Binary or internal decimal items are converted to external 
           decimal.  Negative signed values cause a low-order sign overpunch. 
<p>
 x     o   Internal floating-point numbers are converted to external 
 x         floating-point numbers for display, such that: 
<p>
 x         -   A COMP-1 item will display as if it had an external 
 x             floating-point PICTURE clause of -.9(8)E-99 
 x         -   A COMP-2 item will display as if it had an external 
 x             floating-point PICTURE clause of -.9(17)E-99 
<p>
       No other identifiers require conversion. 
<p>
 x     Data items defined with USAGE IS POINTER are converted to an external 
 x     decimal number that would have a PICTURE clause of PIC 9(10). 
<p>
 x     Index names or data items defined with USAGE IS INDEX cannot be 
 x     specified in a DISPLAY statement. 
<p>
 x     DBCS data items (explicitly defined as USAGE DISPLAY-1) are 
 x     transferred to the sending field of the output device.  For proper 
 x     results, the output device must have the capability to recognize DBCS 
 x     shift-out and shift-in control characters. 
<p>
 x     Both DBCS and non-DBCS operands can be specified in a single DISPLAY 
 x     verb. 
<p>
   <kbd>literal-1</kbd> 
       Can be any figurative constant.  When a figurative constant is 
       specified, only a single occurrence of that figurative constant is 
       displayed. 
<p>
       Each numeric literal must be an unsigned integer. 
<p>
 x     Signed numeric literals and non-integer numeric literals are allowed. 
<p>
 x     Floating-point literals are allowed. 
<p>
 x     DBCS literals are allowed. 
<p>
 x     The ALL figurative constant can be used with DBCS literals in a 
 x     DISPLAY verb. 
<p>
   <kbd>UPON</kbd> 
 x     Mnemonic-name-1 or environment-name-1 must be associated in the 
       SPECIAL-NAMES paragraph with an output device.  A maximum logical 
       record size is assumed for each device, as follows: 
<p>
           The system logical output device = 120 characters 
           The system punch device = 72 characters 
           The console typewriter = 100 characters. 
<p>
       <B>Note:</B>  On the system punch device, characters 73 through 80 are used 
       for PROGRAM-ID name. 
<p>
       When the UPON phrase is omitted, the system's logical output device is 
 x     assumed.  The list of valid environment-names in a DISPLAY statement 
 x     is contained in <A HREF=#2.3.3>Table 6 in topic 2.3.3</A>. 
<p>
   <kbd>WITH</kbd> <kbd>NO</kbd> <kbd>ADVANCING</kbd> 
       When specified, the positioning of the output device will not be 
       changed in any way following the display of the last operand.  If the 
       output device is capable of positioning to a specific character 
       position, it will remain positioned at the character position 
       immediately following the last character of the last operand 
       displayed.  If the output device is not capable of positioning to a 
       specific character position, only the vertical position, if 
       applicable, is affected.  This may cause overprinting. 
<p>
       If the WITH NO ADVANCING phrase is not specified, then after the last 
       operand has been transferred to the output device, the positioning of 
       the output device will be reset to the leftmost position of the next 
       line of the device. 
<p>
   The DISPLAY statement transfers the data in the sending field to the 
   output device.  The size of the sending field is the total character count 
   of all operands listed.  If the output device is capable of receiving data 
   of the same size as the data item being transferred, then the data item is 
   transferred.  If the output device is not capable of receiving data of the 
   same size as the data item being transferred, then one of the following 
   applies: 
<p>
   o   If the total character count is less than the device maximum character 
       count, the remaining rightmost characters are padded with spaces. 
<p>
   o   If the total character count exceeds the maximum, as many records are 
       written as are needed to display all operands.  Any operand being 
       printed or displayed when the end of a record is reached is continued 
       in the next record. 
<p>
 x If a DBCS operand must be split across multiple records, it will be split 
 x only on a double-byte boundary.  The shift code compensation is required 
 x under this case.  That is, when a DBCS operand is split across multiple 
 x records, the shift-in character needs to be inserted at the end of the 
 x current record, and the shift-out character needs to be inserted at the 
 x beginning of the next record.  A space is padded after the shift-in 
 x character, if necessary.  These additional inserted shift codes and spaces 
 x are included in the count while the compiler is calculating the number of 
 x records required. 
<p>
   After the last operand has been transferred to the output device, the 
   device is reset to the leftmost position of the next line of the device. 
<p>
 x If a DBCS data item or literal is specified in a DISPLAY verb, the size of 
 x the sending field is the total character count of all operands listed, 
 x with each DBCS character counted twice, plus the necessary shift codes for 
 x DBCS. 
<p>
   <B>Notes:</B> 
<p>
   1.  The DISPLAY statement causes the printer to space <B>before</B> printing. 
<p>
   2.  The DISPLAY statement can be used to identify data records that have 
       caused one of the following conditions: 
<p>
       a.  A size error 
       b.  An invalid key 
       c.  An overflow condition 
       d.  A status key returned as a value other than zero 
<p>
 |     Such records can be displayed, with an identifying message, on some 
 |     other device than the one used for valid output.  Thus, all records 
 |     that need special handling can be identified.

<p>
   The execution of the EVALUATE statement then proceeds as if the values 
   assigned to the selection subjects and selection objects were compared to 
   determine whether any WHEN phrase satisfies the set of selection subjects. 
   This comparison proceeds as follows: 
<p>
   1.  Each selection object within the set of selection objects for the 
       first WHEN phrase is compared to the selection subject having the same 
       ordinal position within the set of selection subjects.  One of the 
       following conditions must be satisfied if the comparison is to be 
       satisfied: 
<p>
       a.  If the items being compared are assigned numeric or nonnumeric 
           values, or a range of numeric or nonnumeric values, the comparison 
           is satisfied if the value, or one value in the range of values, 
           assigned to the selection object is equal to the value assigned to 
           the selection subject, according to the rules for comparison. 
<p>
       b.  If the items being compared are assigned truth values, the 
           comparison is satisfied if the items are assigned identical truth 
           values. 
<p>
       c.  If the selection object being compared is specified by the word 
           ANY, the comparison is always satisfied, regardless of the value 
           of the selection subject. 
<p>
   2.  If the above comparison is satisfied for every selection object within 
       the set of selection objects being compared, the WHEN phrase 
       containing that set of selection objects is selected as the one 
       satisfying the set of selection subjects. 
<p>
   3.  If the above comparison is not satisfied for every selection object 
       within the set of selection objects being compared, that set of 
       selection objects does not satisfy the set of selection subjects. 
<p>
   4.  This procedure is repeated for subsequent sets of selection objects in 
       the order of their appearance in the source program, until either a 
       WHEN phrase satisfying the set of selection subjects is selected or 
       until all sets of selection objects are exhausted.

   The EXIT statement assigns a name to a given point in a program.  The EXIT 
   statement has no other effect on the compilation or execution of the

   appear in a sentence by itself.  This sentence must be the only sentence 
   in the paragraph. 
<p>
 x This sentence need not be the only sentence in the paragraph. 
<p>
   The EXIT statement is useful for documenting the end point in a series of 
   paragraphs.  If an EXIT paragraph is written as the last paragraph in a 
   declarative procedure or a series of performed procedures, it identifies 
   the point at which control will be transferred. 
<p>

<p>
   1.  Whether identifier-1 references an elementary or group item, all 
       operations are performed as if a series of MOVE statements had been 
       written, each of which had an elementary item as a receiving field. 
<p>
       If the REPLACING phrase is specified: 
<p>
       o   If identifier-1 references a group item, any elementary item 
           within the data item referenced by identifier-1 is initialized 
           only if it belongs to the category specified in the REPLACING 
           phrase. 
<p>
       o   If identifier-1 references an elementary item, that item is 
           initialized only if it belongs to the category specified in the 
           REPLACING phrase. 
<p>
       This initialization takes place as if the data item referenced by 
       identifier-2 or literal-1 acts as the sending operand in an implicit 
       MOVE statement to the identified item. 
<p>
       All such elementary receiving fields, including all occurrences of 
       table items within the group, are affected, with the following 
       exceptions: 
<p>
       o   Index data items 
<p>
 x     o   Data items defined with USAGE IS POINTER 
<p>
       o   Elementary FILLER data items 
<p>
       o   Items that are subordinate to identifier-1 and contain a REDEFINES 
           clause, or any items subordinate to such an item.  (However, 
           identifier-1 can contain a REDEFINES clause or be subordinate to a 
           redefining item.) 
<p>
   2.  The areas referenced by identifier-1 are initialized in the order 
       (left to right) of the appearance of identifier-1 in the statement. 
       Within a group receiving field, affected elementary items are 
       initialized in the order of their definition within the group. 
<p>
   3.  If identifier-1 occupies the same storage area as identifier-2, the 
       result of the execution of this statement is undefined, even if these 
       operands are defined by the same data description entry.

</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   In the following list of comparison rules, the TALLYING and REPLACING 
   phrases are the items being compared: 
<p>
   1.  When both the TALLYING and REPLACING phrases are specified, the 
       INSPECT statement is executed as if an INSPECT TALLYING statement were 
       specified, immediately followed by an INSPECT REPLACING statement. 
<p>
   2.  The first comparand is compared with an equal number of leftmost 
       contiguous characters in the inspected item.  The comparand matches 
       the inspected characters only if both are equal, 
       character-for-character. 
<p>
   3.  If no match occurs for the first comparand, the comparison is repeated 
       for each successive comparand until either a match is found or all 
       comparands have been acted upon. 
<p>
   4.  If a match is found, tallying or replacing takes place, as described 
       in the following TALLYING/REPLACING phrase descriptions.  In the 
       inspected item, the first character following the rightmost matching 
       character is now considered to be in the leftmost character position. 
       The process described in rules 2 and 3 is then repeated. 
<p>
   5.  If no match is found, then, in the inspected item, the first character 
       following the leftmost inspected character is now considered to be in 
       the leftmost character position.  The process described in rules 2 and 
       3 is then repeated. 
<p>
   6.  If the CHARACTERS phrase is specified, an implied 1-character 
       comparand is used in the process described in rules 2 and 3.  The 
       implied character is always considered to match the inspected 
       character in the inspected item. 
<p>
   7.  The actions taken in rules 1 through 6 (defined as the <B>comparison</B> 
       <B>cycle</B>) are repeated until the rightmost character in the inspected 
       item has either been matched or has been considered as being in the 
       leftmost character position.  Inspection is then terminated. 
<p>
   When the BEFORE or AFTER phrase is specified, the preceding rules are 
   modified, as described in <A HREF=#3.20.4>&quot;BEFORE and AFTER Phrases (All Formats)&quot; in</A> 
   <A HREF=#3.20.4>topic 3.20.4</A>.

       The count field.  It must be an elementary integer item defined 
       without the symbol P in its PICTURE character-string.  You must 
       initialize identifier-2 before the INSPECT statement is executed. 
<p>
   <kbd>identifier-3</kbd> <kbd>or</kbd> <kbd>literal-1</kbd> 
       The tallying field.  If the tallying field is a figurative constant, 
       it is considered to be a 1-character nonnumeric literal. 
<p>
<p>
   When neither the BEFORE nor AFTER phrase is specified, the following 
   actions take place when the INSPECT TALLYING statement is executed: 
<p>
   o   If ALL is specified, the count field is increased by 1 for each 
       non-overlapping occurrence in the inspected item of this tallying 
       operand, beginning at the leftmost character position and continuing 
       to the rightmost. 
<p>
   o   If LEADING is specified, the count field is increased by 1 for each 
       contiguous non-overlapping occurrence of this tallying operand in the 
       inspected item, provided that the leftmost such occurrence is at the 
       point where comparison began in the first comparison cycle for which 
       this tallying operand is eligible to participate. 
<p>
   o   If CHARACTERS is specified, the count field is increased by 1 for each 
       character (including the space character) in the inspected item. 
       Thus, execution of the INSPECT TALLYING statement increases the value 
       in the count field by the number of characters in the inspected item.

       The substitution field. 
<p>
<p>
   The subject field and the substitution field must be the same length.  The 
   following replacement rules apply: 
<p>
   o   If the subject field is a figurative constant, it is considered to be 
       a 1-character nonnumeric literal.  Each character in the inspected 
       item equivalent to the figurative constant is replaced by the 
       single-character substitution field, which must be 1 character in 
       length. 
<p>
   o   If the substitution field is a figurative constant, the substitution 
       field is considered to be the same length as the subject field.  Each 
       non-overlapping occurrence of the subject field in the inspected item 
       is replaced by the substitution field. 
<p>
   o   When the subject and substitution fields are character-strings, each 
       non-overlapping occurrence of the subject field in the inspected item 
       is replaced by the character-string specified in the substitution 
       field. 
<p>
   o   Once replacement has occurred in a given character position in the 
       inspected item, no further replacement for that character position is 
       made in this execution of the INSPECT statement. 
<p>
   When the CHARACTERS phrase is used, literal-3 or identifier-5 must be 1 
   character in length. 
<p>
   When neither the BEFORE nor AFTER phrase is specified, the following 
   actions take place when the INSPECT REPLACING statement is executed: 
<p>
   o   If CHARACTERS is specified, the substitution field must be 1 character 
       in length.  Each character in the inspected field is replaced by the 
       substitution field, beginning at the leftmost character and continuing 
       to the rightmost. 
<p>
   o   If ALL is specified, each non-overlapping occurrence of the subject 
       field in the inspected item is replaced by the substitution field, 
       beginning at the leftmost character and continuing to the rightmost. 
<p>
   o   If LEADING is specified, each contiguous non-overlapping occurrence of 
       the subject field in the inspected item is replaced by the 
       substitution field, provided that the leftmost such occurrence is at 
       the point where comparison began in the first comparison cycle for 
       which this substitution field is eligible to participate. 
<p>
   o   If FIRST is specified, the leftmost occurrence of the subject field in 
       the inspected item is replaced by the substitution field.

   No more than one BEFORE phrase and one AFTER phrase can be specified for 
   any one ALL, LEADING, CHARACTERS, FIRST or CONVERTING phrase. 
<p>
   When these phrases are specified, the preceding rules for counting and 
   replacing are modified. 
<p>
   <kbd>identifier-4,</kbd> <kbd>literal-2</kbd> 
       These are not counted or replaced. However, the counting and/or 
       replacing of the inspected item is bounded by the presence of the 
       identifiers and literals. 
<p>
       If the delimiter (identifier-4 or literal-2) is a figurative constant, 
       it is considered to be 1 character in length. 
<p>
<p>
   When BEFORE is specified, counting and/or replacing of the inspected item 
   begins at the leftmost character and continues until the first occurrence 
   of the delimiter is encountered.  If no delimiter is present in the 
   inspected item, counting and/or replacing continues toward the rightmost 
   character. 
<p>
   When AFTER is specified, counting and/or replacing of the inspected item 
   begins with the first character to the right of the delimiter and 
   continues toward the rightmost character in the inspected item.  If no 
   delimiter is present in the inspected item, no counting or replacement

<A NAME=3.21.1><H3> 3.21.1   ASCENDING/DESCENDING KEY Phrase</H3></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   This phrase specifies that records are to be processed in an ascending or 
   descending sequence (depending on the phrase specified), based on the 
   specified merge keys. 
<p>
   <kbd>data-name-1</kbd> 
       Specifies a KEY data item on which the merge will be based. Each such 
       data-name must identify a data item in a record associated with 
       <B>file-name-1</B>.  The data-names following the word KEY are listed from 
       left to right in the MERGE statement in order of decreasing 
       significance without regard to how they are divided into KEY phrases. 
       The left-most data-name is the major key, the next data-name is the 
       next most significant key, and so forth. 
<p>
       The following rules apply: 
<p>
       o   A specific key data item must be physically located in the same 
           position and have the same data format in each input file. 
           However, it need not have the same data-name. 
<p>
       o   If file-name-1 has more than one record description, then the KEY 
           data items need be described in only one of the record 
           descriptions. 
<p>
       o   If file-name-1 contains variable-length records, all of the KEY 
           data-items must be contained within the first <I>n</I> character 
 |         positions of the record, where <I>n</I> equals the minimum record size 
           specified for file-name-1. 
<p>
       o   KEY data items must not contain an OCCURS clause or be subordinate 
           to an item that contains an OCCURS clause. 
<p>
       o   KEY data items can be qualified. 
<p>
       o   KEY data items cannot be group items that contain variable 
           occurrence data items. 
<p>
 x     o   KEY data items can be floating-point items. 
<p>
 x     o   KEY data items cannot be variably-located. 
<p>
<p>
       The direction of the merge operation depends on the specification of 
       the ASCENDING or DESCENDING keywords as follows: 
<p>
       o   When ASCENDING is specified, the sequence is from the lowest key 
           value to the highest key value. 
<p>
       o   When DESCENDING is specified, the sequence is from the highest key 
           value to the lowest. 
<p>
       o   If the KEY data item is alphabetic, alphanumeric, 
           alphanumeric-edited, or numeric-edited, the sequence of key values 
           depends on the collating sequence used (see <A HREF=#3.21.2>&quot;COLLATING SEQUENCE</A> 
           <A HREF=#3.21.2>Phrase&quot; in topic 3.21.2</A> below). 
<p>
 x     o   If the KEY is an external floating-point item, the key is treated 
 x         as alphanumeric.  The sequence in which the records are merged 
 x         depends on the collating sequence used. 
<p>
 x     o   If the KEY is an internal floating-point item, the sequence of key 
 x         values will be in numeric order. 
<p>
       The key comparisons are performed according to the rules for 
       comparison of operands in a relation condition (see <A HREF=#2.8.5.4>&quot;Relation</A> 
       <A HREF=#2.8.5.4>Condition&quot; in topic 2.8.5.4</A>).

<p>
   When the GIVING phrase is specified, all the merged records in file-name-1 
   are automatically transferred to the output files (file-name-4). 
<p>
   All output files must specify sequential or dynamic access mode and be 
   described in FD entries in the Data Division. 
<p>
   If the output files (file-name-4) contain variable-length records, the 
   size of the records contained in file-name-1 must not be less than the 
   smallest record nor greater than the largest record described for the 
   output files. If the output files contain fixed-length records, the size 
   of the records contained in file-name-1 must not be greater than the 
   largest record described for the output files.  For more information, see 
   <cite>VS</cite> <cite>COBOL</cite> <cite>II</cite> <cite>Application</cite> <cite>Programming</cite> <cite>Guide</cite> <cite>for</cite> <cite>MVS</cite> <cite>and</cite> <cite>CMS</cite> or <cite>VS</cite> <cite>COBOL</cite> <cite>II</cite> 
   <cite>Application</cite> <cite>Programming</cite> <cite>Guide</cite> <cite>for</cite> <cite>VSE.</cite> 
<p>
   At the time the MERGE statement is executed, the output files 
   (file-name-4) must not be open. For each of the output files, the 
   execution of the MERGE statement causes the following actions to be taken: 
<p>
   1.  The processing of the file is initiated. The initiation is performed 
       as if an OPEN statement with the OUTPUT phrase had been executed. 
<p>
   2.  The merged logical records are returned and written onto the file. 
       Each record is written as if a WRITE statement without any optional 
       phrases had been executed. 
<p>
 |     If file-name-4 is an INDEXED file, then the associated key data-name 
 |     for that file must have an ASCENDING KEY phrase in the MERGE 
 |     statement.  This same data-name must occupy the identical character 
 |     positions in its record as the data item associated with the prime 
 |     record key for the file. 
<p>
       For a relative file, the relative key data item for the first record 
       returned contains the value '1'; for the second record returned, the 
       value '2', etc..  After execution of the MERGE statement, the content 
       of the relative key data item indicates the last record returned to 
       the file. 
<p>
   3.  The processing of the file is terminated.  The termination is 
       performed as if a CLOSE statement without optional phrases had been 
       executed. 
<p>
   These implicit functions are performed such that any associated USE AFTER 
   EXCEPTION/ERROR procedures are executed; however, the execution of such a 
   USE procedure must not cause the execution of any statement manipulating 
   the file referenced by, or accessing the record area associated with, 
   file-name-4.  On the first attempt to write beyond the externally defined 
   boundaries of the file, any USE AFTER STANDARD EXCEPTION/ERROR procedure 
   specified for the file is executed.  If control is returned from that USE 
   procedure or if no such USE procedure is specified, the processing of the 
   file is terminated.

<A NAME=3.21.5><H3> 3.21.5   OUTPUT PROCEDURE Phrase</H3></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   This phrase specifies the name of a procedure that is to select or modify 
   output records from the merge operation. 
<p>
   <kbd>proc-name-1</kbd> 
       Specifies the first (or only) section or paragraph in the OUTPUT 
       PROCEDURE. 
<p>
   <kbd>proc-name-2</kbd> 
       Identifies the last section or paragraph of the OUTPUT PROCEDURE. 
<p>
   The OUTPUT PROCEDURE can consist of any procedure needed to select, 
   modify, or copy the records that are made available one at at time by the 
   RETURN statement in merged order from the file referenced by file-name-1. 
   The range includes all statements that are executed as the result of a 
   transfer of control by CALL, EXIT, GO TO, and PERFORM statements in the 
   range of the output procedure.  The range also includes all statements in 
   declarative procedures that are executed as a result of the execution of 
   statements in the range of the output procedure. The range of the output 
   procedure must not cause the execution of any MERGE, RELEASE, or SORT 
   statement. 
<p>
   If an output procedure is specified, control passes to it after the file 
   referenced by file-name-1 has been sequenced by the MERGE statement.  The 
   compiler inserts a return mechanism at the end of the last statement in 
   the output procedure and when control passes the last statement in the 
   output procedure, the return mechanism provides the termination of the 
   merge and then passes control to the next executable statement after the 
   MERGE statement. Before entering the output procedure, the merge procedure 
   reaches a point at which it can select the next record in merged order 
   when requested, The RETURN statements in the output procedure are the 
   requests for the next record. 
<p>
   <B>Note:</B>  The OUTPUT PROCEDURE phrase is similar to a basic PERFORM 
   statement. For example, if you name a procedure in an OUTPUT PROCEDURE, 
   that procedure is executed during the merging operation just as if it were 
   named in a PERFORM statement. As with the PERFORM statement, execution of 
   the procedure is terminated after the last statement completes execution. 
   The last statement in an OUTPUT PROCEDURE can be the EXIT statement (see 
   <A HREF=#3.14>&quot;EXIT Statement&quot; in topic 3.14</A>).

<A NAME=3.22.1><H3> 3.22.1   Elementary Moves</H3></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   An elementary move is one in which the receiving item is an elementary 
   item, and the sending item is an elementary item or a literal.  Any 
   necessary conversion of data from one form of internal representation to 
   another takes place during the move, along with any specified editing in, 
   or de-editing implied by, the receiving item.  Each elementary item 
   belongs to one of the following categories: 
<p>
       <B>Alphabetic</B>--includes alphabetic data items and the figurative constant 
       SPACE. 
<p>
       <B>Alphanumeric</B>--includes alphanumeric data items, nonnumeric literals, 
 |     and all figurative constants except SPACE.  (The figurative constant 
 |     ZERO is alphanumeric only when it is moved to an alphanumeric or 
 |     alphanumeric-edited item). 
<p>
       <B>Alphanumeric-Edited</B>--includes alphanumeric-edited data items. 
<p>
       <B>Numeric</B>--includes numeric data items, numeric literals, and the 
       figurative constant ZERO (when ZERO is moved to a numeric or 
       numeric-edited item). 
<p>
       <B>Numeric-Edited</B>--includes numeric-edited data items. 
<p>
 x     <B>Floating-point</B>--includes internal floating-point items (defined as 
 x     USAGE COMP-1 or USAGE COMP-2), external floating-point items (defined 
 x     as USAGE DISPLAY), and floating-point literals. 
<p>
 x     <B>DBCS</B>--includes DBCS data items (defined explicitly or implicitly as 
 x     USAGE DISPLAY-1) and DBCS literals. 
<p>
<p>
 | The following rules outline the execution of valid elementary moves.  When 
 | the receiving item is: 
<p>
   <B>Alphabetic</B>: 
<p>
<p>
   o   Alignment and any necessary space filling occur as described under 
       <A HREF=#2.5.3.6>&quot;Alignment Rules&quot; in topic 2.5.3.6</A>. 
<p>
   o   If the size of the sending item is greater than the size of the 
       receiving item, excess characters on the right are truncated after the 
       receiving item is filled. 
<p>
   <B>Alphanumeric</B> or <B>Alphanumeric-Edited</B>: 
<p>
   o   Alignment and any necessary space filling take place, as described 
       under <A HREF=#2.5.3.6>&quot;Alignment Rules&quot; in topic 2.5.3.6</A>. 
<p>
   o   If the size of the sending item is greater than the size of the 
       receiving item, excess characters on the right are truncated after the 
       receiving item is filled. 
<p>
   o   If the sending item has an operational sign, the unsigned value is 
       used.  If the operational sign occupies a separate character, that 
       character is not moved, and the size of the sending item is considered 
       to be 1 less character than the actual size. 
<p>
<p>
   <B>Numeric</B> or <B>Numeric-edited</B>: 
<p>
   o   Except where zeros are replaced because of editing requirements, 
       alignment by decimal point and any necessary zero filling take place, 
       as described under <A HREF=#2.5.3.6>&quot;Alignment Rules&quot; in topic 2.5.3.6</A>. 
<p>
   o   If the receiving item is signed, the sign of the sending item is 
       placed in the receiving item, with any necessary sign conversion.  If 
       the sending item is unsigned, a positive operational sign is generated 
       for the receiving item. 
<p>
   o   If the receiving item is unsigned, the absolute value of the sending 
       item is moved, and no operational sign is generated for the receiving 
       item. 
<p>
   o   When the sending item is alphanumeric, the data is moved as if the 
       sending item were described as an unsigned integer. 
<p>
 x o   When the sending item is floating-point, the data is first converted 
 x     to either a binary or internal decimal representation and is then 
 x     moved. 
<p>
   o   De-editing allows moving a numeric-edited data item into a numeric or 
       numeric-edited receiver.  The compiler accomplishes this by first 
       establishing the unedited value of the numeric-edited item (this value 
       can be signed), then moving the unedited numeric value to the 
       receiving numeric or numeric-edited data item. 
<p>
 x <B>Floating-point</B>: 
<p>
 x o   The sending item is converted first to internal floating-point and 
 x     then moved. 
<p>
 x o   When data is moved to or from an external floating-point item, the 
 x     data is converted first to or from its equivalent internal 
 x     floating-point value. 
<p>
 x <B>DBCS:</B> 
<p>
 x o   No conversion takes place. 
<p>
 x o   If the sending and receiving items are not the same size, the data 
 x     item will be either truncated or padded with DBCS spaces on the right. 
<p>
   <B>Notes:</B> 
<p>
 | 1.  If the receiving item is alphanumeric or numeric-edited, and the 
 |     sending item is a scaled integer (that is, has a P as the rightmost 
       character in its PICTURE character-string), the scaling positions are 
       treated as trailing zeros when the MOVE statement is executed. 
<p>
 | 2.  If the receiving item is numeric and the sending item is alphanumeric 
 |     literal or ALL literal, then all characters of the literal must be 
       numeric characters. 
<p>
<p>
   Table 35 shows valid and invalid elementary moves for each category.  In

   At least one of the phrases, INPUT, OUTPUT, I-O, or EXTEND, must be 
   specified with the OPEN keyword.  The INPUT, OUTPUT, I-O, and EXTEND 
   phrases can appear in any order. 
<p>
   <kbd>INPUT</kbd> 
       Permits opening the file for input operations. 
<p>
   <kbd>OUTPUT</kbd> 
       Permits opening the file for output operations.  This phrase can be 
       specified when the file is being created. 
<p>
       <B>Note:</B>   The OUTPUT option should NOT be specified for a file that: 
<p>
       o   Contains records. The file will be replaced by new data. 
<p>
       o   Is defined with a DD dummy card when running under MVS. 
           Unpredictable results may occur. 
<p>
   <kbd>I-O</kbd> 
       Permits opening the file for both input and output operations.  The 
       I-O phrase can be specified only for files assigned to direct access 
       devices. 
<p>
   <kbd>EXTEND</kbd> 
       Permits opening the file for output operations under MVS or CMS. 
<p>
       The EXTEND phrase is only allowed for sequential access files. 
<p>
       <B>Note:</B>  The EXTEND phrase must not be specified for SAM files running 
       under VSE.  For more information about the OPEN statement in VSE 
       environments, see <cite>VS</cite> <cite>COBOL</cite> <cite>II</cite> <cite>Application</cite> <cite>Programming</cite> <cite>Guide</cite> <cite>for</cite> <cite>VSE.</cite> 
<p>
       The EXTEND phrase must not be specified for a multiple file reel. 
<p>
       The EXTEND phrase is not allowed for files for which the LINAGE clause 
       has been specified. 
<p>
 x     The EXTEND phrase is allowed for files for which the LINAGE clause has 
 x     been specified. 
<p>
   <kbd>file-name-1,</kbd> <kbd>file-name-2,</kbd> <kbd>file-name-3,</kbd> <kbd>file-name-4</kbd> 
       Designates a file upon which the OPEN statement is to operate.  If 
       more than one file is specified, the files need not have the same 
       organization or access.  Each file-name must be defined in an FD entry 
       in the Data Division, and must not name a sort or merge file.  The FD 
       entry must be equivalent to the information supplied when the file was 
       defined. 
<p>
   <kbd>REVERSED</kbd> 
       Valid only for sequential single reel files. 
<p>
 |     <B>Note:</B>  The REVERSED phrase is an obsolete element and will be deleted 
 |     from the next revision of the COBOL 85 Standard. 
<p>
   <kbd>NO</kbd> <kbd>REWIND</kbd> 
       Valid only for sequential single reel files. 
<p>
   The following rules apply: 
<p>
   o   If a file opened with the INPUT phrase is an optional file which is 
       not present, the OPEN statement sets the file position indicator to 
       indicate that an optional input file is not present. 
<p>
   o   The successful execution of an OPEN INPUT or OPEN I-O statement sets 
       the file position indicator to 1. 
<p>
   o   When the REVERSED, NO REWIND, or EXTEND phrases are not specified, 
       OPEN statement execution positions the file at its beginning. 
<p>
   o   When the EXTEND phrase is specified under MVS or CMS, the OPEN 
       statement positions the file immediately after the last record written 
       in the file. 
<p>
   o   When NO REWIND is specified, the OPEN statement execution does not 
       reposition the file; prior to OPEN statement execution, the file must 
       be positioned at its beginning. 
<p>
   o   When REVERSED is specified, OPEN statement execution positions the 
       QSAM or VSAM file at its end; for SAM files, OPEN statement execution 
       merely reverses the order of records without repositioning the file. 
       Subsequent READ statements make the data records available in reversed 
       order, starting with the last record. 
<p>
   If the concept of reels has no meaning for the storage medium (for 
   example, a direct access device), the REVERSED and NO REWIND phrases do 
   not apply.

<p>
   <B>INPUT</B> <B>files</B>    The beginning labels are checked. 
<p>
   <B>OUTPUT</B> <B>files</B>   The beginning labels are written. 
<p>
   <B>I-O</B> <B>files</B>      The labels are checked; new labels are then written. 
<p>
   <B>EXTEND</B> <B>files</B>   Under MVS or CMS the following procedures are executed: 
<p>
                  o   Beginning file labels are processed only if this is a 
                      single-volume file. 
<p>
                  o   Beginning volume labels of the last existing volume are 
                      processed as though the file was being opened with the 
                      INPUT phrase. 
<p>
                  o   Existing ending file labels are processed as though the 
                      file was being opened with the INPUT phrase; they are 
                      then deleted. 
<p>
                  o   Processing continues as if the file were opened as an 
                      OUTPUT file. 
<p>
   When label records are specified but not present, or are present but not 
   specified, execution of the OPEN statement is unpredictable.

   At least one of the phrases, INPUT, OUTPUT, I-O or EXTEND, must be 
   specified with the OPEN keyword.  The INPUT, OUTPUT, I-O and EXTEND 
   phrases can appear in any order. 
<p>
   <kbd>INPUT</kbd> 
       Permits opening the file for input operations. 
<p>
   <kbd>OUTPUT</kbd> 
       Permits opening the file for output operations.  This phrase can be 
       specified when the file is being created.  If the OUTPUT phrase is 
       specified for a file that contains records, the file (which must be 
       defined as reusable) will be replaced by the new data. 
<p>
   <kbd>I-O</kbd> 
       Permits opening the file for both input and output operations.  The 
       I-O phrase can be specified only for files assigned to direct access 
       devices. 
<p>
   <kbd>EXTEND</kbd> 
       Permits opening the file for output operations. 
       The EXTEND phrase is only allowed for sequential access files. 
<p>
   <kbd>file-name-1,</kbd> <kbd>file-name-2,</kbd> <kbd>file-name-3,</kbd> <kbd>file-name-4</kbd> 
       Designates a file upon which the OPEN statement is to operate.  If 
       more than one file is specified, the files need not have the same 
       organization or access.  Each file-name must be defined in an FD entry 
       in the Data Division, and must not name a sort or merge file.  The FD 
       entry must be equivalent to the information supplied when the file was 
       defined. 
<p>
   Execution of an OPEN INPUT or OPEN I-O statement sets the file position 
   indicator: 
<p>
   o   For VSAM sequential and indexed files, to the characters with the 
       lowest ordinal position in the collating sequence associated with the 
       file. 
<p>
   o   For VSAM relative files, to 1. 
<p>
   If no records exist in the file, the file position indicator is set so 
   that the first Format 1 READ statement executed results in an AT END 
   condition. 
<p>
   When an OPEN EXTEND statement is executed, the file is prepared for the 
   addition of records immediately following the last record in the file. 
   (The record with the highest prime record key value is considered the last 
   record.)  Subsequent WRITE statements add records as if the file were 
   opened OUTPUT.  The EXTEND option can be specified when a file is being 
   created; it can also be specified for a file that contains records, or 
   that has contained records that have been deleted. 
<p>
 x If the PASSWORD clause is specified in the FILE-CONTROL entry, the 
 x password data item must contain the valid password before the OPEN 
 x statement is executed.  If the valid password is not present, the OPEN 
 x statement execution is unsuccessful.

   1.  The successful execution of an OPEN statement determines the 
       availability of the file and results in that file being in open mode. 
       A file is available if it is physically present and is recognized by 
       the input-output control system.  Table 36 shows the results of 
       opening available and unavailable files.  For more information 
       regarding file availability, see <cite>VS</cite> <cite>COBOL</cite> <cite>II</cite> <cite>Application</cite> <cite>Programming</cite>

   2.  The successful execution of the OPEN statement makes the associated 
       record area available to the program; it does not obtain or release 
       the first data record. 
<p>
   3.  An OPEN statement must be successfully executed prior to the execution 
       of any of the permissible input-output statements, except a SORT or 
       MERGE statement with the USING or GIVING phrase.  Table 37 shows the 
       permissible input-output statements for sequential files.  An 'X' 
       indicates that the specified statement can be used with the open mode 
       given at the top of the column.

   4.  When OPEN REVERSED is specified, the record format must be fixed. 
<p>
   5.  A file can be opened for INPUT, OUTPUT, I-O, or EXTEND (sequential 
       files only) in the same program.  After the first OPEN statement 
       execution for a given file, each subsequent OPEN statement execution 
       must be preceded by a successful CLOSE file statement execution 
       without the REEL or UNIT phrase (for sequential files only), or the 
       LOCK phrase. 
<p>
   6.  If the FILE STATUS clause is specified in the FILE-CONTROL entry, the 
       associated status key is updated when the OPEN statement is executed. 
<p>
   7.  If an OPEN statement is issued for a file already in the open status, 
       the EXCEPTION/ERROR procedure (if specified) for this file is 
       executed. 
<p>
   8.  When the NO REWIND phrase is specified or when both the NO REWIND and 
       REVERSE phrases are omitted, file positioning is specified with the 
       LABEL parameter of the DD statement under MVS and with the &quot;label 
       processing&quot; operand under CMS.

   after execution of the specified procedure(s) is completed. 
<p>
 | The PERFORM statement can be: 
<p>

       When both procedure-name-1 and procedure-name-2 are specified, if 
       either is a procedure-name in a declarative procedure, both must be 
       procedure-names in the same declarative procedure. 
<p>
       If procedure-name-1 is specified, imperative-statement-1 and the 
       END-PERFORM phrase must not be specified.

       END-PERFORM phrase must be specified. 
<p>

       The statements to be executed for an in-line PERFORM. 
<p>
 x     Imperative-statement-1 is optional. 
<p>
   <kbd>END-PERFORM</kbd> 
       Delimits the scope of the in-line PERFORM statement.  Execution of an 
       in-line PERFORM is completed after the last statement contained within 
       it has been executed. 
<p>
   An in-line PERFORM statement functions according to the same general rules 
   as an otherwise identical out-of-line PERFORM statement, except that 
   statements contained within the in-line PERFORM are executed in place of 
   the statements contained within the range of procedure-name-1 (through 
   procedure-name-2, if specified).  Unless specifically qualified by the 
   word <B>in-line</B> or <B>out-of-line</B>, all the rules that apply to the out-of-line 
   PERFORM statement also apply to the in-line PERFORM. 
<p>
   Whenever an out-of-line PERFORM statement is executed, control is 
   transferred to the first statement of the procedure named 
   procedure-name-1.  Control is always returned to the statement following 
   the PERFORM statement.  The point from which this control is returned is 
   determined as follows: 
<p>
   o   If procedure-name-1 is a paragraph name and procedure-name-2 is not 
       specified, the return is made after the execution of the last 
       statement of the procedure-name-1 paragraph. 
<p>
   o   If procedure-name-1 is a section name and procedure-name-2 is not 
       specified, the return is made after the execution of the last 
       statement of the last paragraph in the procedure-name-1 section. 
<p>
   o   If procedure-name-2 is specified and it is a paragraph name, the 
       return is made after the execution of the last statement of the 
       procedure-name-2 paragraph. 
<p>
   o   If procedure-name-2 is specified and it is a section name, the return 
       is made after the execution of the last statement of the last 
       paragraph in the procedure-name-2 section. 
<p>
   The only necessary relationship between procedure-name-1 and 
   procedure-name-2 is that a consecutive sequence of operations is executed, 
   beginning at the procedure named by procedure-name-1 and ending with the 
   execution of the procedure named by procedure-name-2. 
<p>
   PERFORM statements can be specified within the performed procedure.  If 
   there are two or more logical paths to the return point, then 
   procedure-name-2 can name a paragraph that consists only of an EXIT 
   statement; all the paths to the return point must then lead to this 
   paragraph. 
<p>
   When the performed procedures include another PERFORM statement, the 
   sequence of procedures associated with the embedded PERFORM statement must 
   be totally included in or totally excluded from the performed procedures 
   of the first PERFORM statement.  That is, an active PERFORM statement 
   whose execution point begins within the range of performed procedures of 
   another active PERFORM statement must not allow control to pass through 
   the exit point of the other active PERFORM statement.  In addition, two or 
   more such active PERFORM statements must not have a common exit. 
<p>
 x Two or more active PERFORM statements can have a common exit.

   The way in which operands are increased or decreased depends on the number 
   of variables specified.  In the following discussion, every reference to 
   identifier-n refers equally to index-name-n (except when identifier-n is 
   the object of the BY phrase). 
<p>
   If identifier-2 or identifier-5 is subscripted, the subscripts are 
   evaluated each time the content of the data item referenced by the 
   identifier is set or augmented.  If identifier-3, identifier-4, 
   identifier-6, or identifier-7 is subscripted, the subscripts are evaluated 
   each time the content of the date item referenced by the identifier is 
   used in a setting or an augmenting operation.

<A NAME=3.25.9><H3> 3.25.9   Varying Phrase Rules</H3></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   No matter how many variables are specified, the following rules apply: 
<p>
   1.  In the VARYING/AFTER phrases, when an index-name is specified: 
<p>
       a.  The index-name is initialized and incremented or decremented 
           according to the rules under <A HREF=#2.7.6.1.2>&quot;INDEXED BY Phrase&quot; in</A> 
           <A HREF=#2.7.6.1.2>topic 2.7.6.1.2</A>.  (See also <A HREF=#3.31>&quot;SET Statement&quot; in topic 3.31</A>.) 
<p>
       b.  In the associated FROM phrase, an identifier must be described as 
           an integer and have a positive value; a literal must be a positive 
           integer. 
<p>
       c.  In the associated BY phrase, an identifier must be described as an 
           integer; a literal must be a nonzero integer. 
<p>
   2.  In the FROM phrase, when an index-name is specified: 
<p>
       a.  In the associated VARYING/AFTER phrase, an identifier must be 
           described as an integer.  It is initialized, as described in the 
           SET statement. 
<p>
       b.  In the associated BY phrase, an identifier must be described as an 
           integer and have a nonzero value; a literal must be a nonzero 
           integer. 
<p>
   3.  In the BY phrase, identifiers and literals must have nonzero values. 
<p>
   4.  Changing the values of identifiers and/or index-names in the VARYING, 
       FROM, and BY phrases during execution changes the number of times the 
       procedures are executed.

       Must be defined in a Data Division FD entry. 
<p>
   <kbd>NEXT</kbd> <kbd>RECORD</kbd> 
 |     The next record in the logical sequence of records.  NEXT is optional 
 |     when ACCESS MODE IS SEQUENTIAL; it has no effect on READ statement 
       execution. 
<p>
   <kbd>INTO</kbd> <kbd>Identifier-1</kbd> 
       Identifier-1 is the receiving field. 
<p>
       The result of the execution of a READ statement with the INTO phrase 
       is equivalent to the application of the following rules in the order 
       specified: 
<p>
       o   The execution of the same READ statement without the INTO phrase. 
<p>
       o   The current record is moved from the record area to the area 
           specified by identifier-1 according to the rules for the MOVE 
           statement without the CORRESPONDING phrase.  The size of the 
           current record is determined by rules specified for the RECORD 
           clause.  If the file description entry contains a RECORD IS 
           VARYING clause, the implied move is a group move.  The implied 
           MOVE statement does not occur if the execution of the READ 
           statement was unsuccessful.  Any subscripting or reference 
           modification associated with identifier-1 is evaluated after the 
           record has been read and immediately before it is moved to the 
           data item.  The record is available in both the record area and 
           the data item referenced by identifier-1. 
<p>
       The INTO phrase can be specified in a READ if: 
<p>
       o   Only one record description is subordinate to the file description 
           entry, or 
<p>
       o   All record-names associated with file-name-1, and the data item 
           referenced by identifier-1, describe a group item or an elementary 
           alphanumeric item. 
<p>
 |     The record areas associated with file-name-1 and identifier-1 must not 
 |     be the same storage area. 
<p>
 x     Identifier-1 (the record area) can be a DBCS or floating-point data 
 x     item. 
<p>
 x     Multiple non-alphanumeric records can be specified for file-name-1. 
 x     Identifier-1 need not describe a group item or an elementary 
 x     alphanumeric item. The following rules apply: 
<p>
 x     1.  If the file referenced by file-name-1 is V-format, or a QSAM or 
 x         SAM file with RECORDING MODE 'S' or 'U', a group move will take 
 x         place. 
<p>
 x     2.  If the file referenced by file-name-1 is F-format, the movement 
 x         will take place according to the rules for the MOVE statement, 
 x         using, as a sending field description, the record that specifies 
 x         the largest number of character positions. If more than one such 
 x         record exists, the sending field record selected will be the one 
 x         among those records that appears first under the description of 
 x         file-name-1.

   If more than one record description entry is associated with file-name-1, 
   these records automatically share the same storage area; that is, they are 
   implicitly redefined.  After a READ statement is executed, only those data 
   items within the range of the current record are replaced; data items 
   stored beyond that range are undefined.  Figure 15 illustrates this 
   concept.  If the range of the current record exceeds the record 
   description entries for file-name-1, the record is truncated on the right 
   to the maximum size. In either of these cases, the READ statement is 
   successful and an I-O status (04) is set indicating a record length 
   conflict has occurred.

   If SELECT OPTIONAL is specified in the FILE-CONTROL entry for this file, 
   and the file is absent during this execution of the object program, 
   execution of the first READ statement causes an at end condition; however,

   actions occur: 
<p>
   1.  The file position indicator is set and the I-O status associated with 
       file-name-1 is updated. 
<p>
   2.  If an exception condition that is not an at end condition exists, 
       control is transferred to the end of the READ statement following the 
       execution of any USE AFTER STANDARD EXCEPTION procedure applicable to 
       file-name-1.

       If no USE AFTER STANDARD EXCEPTION procedure is specified, control is 
       transferred to the end of the READ statement or to 
       imperative-statement-2, if specified. 
<p>
   3.  If no exception condition exists, the record is made available in the 
       record area and any implicit move resulting from the presence of an 
       INTO phrase is executed.  Control is transferred to the end of the 
       READ statement or to imperative-statement-2, if specified.  In the 
       latter case, execution continues according to the rules for each 
       statement specified in imperative-statement-2.  If a procedure

   Execution of a Format 2 READ statement causes the value of the key of 
   reference to be compared with the value of the corresponding key data item 
   in the file records, until the first record having an equal value is 
   found.  The file position indicator is positioned to this record, which is 
   then made available.  If no record can be so identified, an INVALID KEY

<p>
       If more than one record description is associated with file-name-1, 
       these records automatically share the same storage; that is, the area 
       is implicitly redefined.  After RETURN statement execution, only the 
       contents of the current record are available; if any data items lie 
       beyond the length of the current record, their contents are undefined. 
<p>
   <kbd>INTO</kbd> <kbd>phrase</kbd> 
       The result of the execution of a RETURN statement with the INTO phrase

       specified: 
<p>
       o   The execution of the same RETURN statement without the INTO 
           phrase. 
<p>
       o   The current record is moved from the record area to the area 
           specified by identifier-1 according to the rules for the MOVE 
           statement without the CORRESPONDING phrase.  The size of the 
           current record is determined by rules specified for the RECORD 
           clause.  If the file description entry contains a RECORD IS 
           VARYING clause, the implied move is a group move.  The implied 
           MOVE statement does not occur if the execution of the RETURN 
           statement was unsuccessful.  Any subscripting or reference 
           modification associated with identifier-1 is evaluated after the 
           record has been read and immediately before it is moved to the 
           data item.  The record is available in both the record area and 
           the data item referenced by identifier-1. 
<p>
<p>
   <kbd>identifier-1</kbd> 
 x     Identifier-1 (the record area) can be a floating-point data item or

<p>
   The record areas associated with file-name-1 and identifier-1 must not be 
   the same storage area. 
<p>
   The INTO phrase can be specified in a RETURN statement if one or both of 
   the following are true: 
<p>
   o   If only one record description is subordinate to the sort-merge file 
       description entry 
<p>
   o   If all record-names associated with file-name-1 and the data item 
       referenced by identifier-1 describe a group item or an elementary 
       alphanumeric item. 
<p>
 x Multiple non-alphanumeric records can be specified for file-name-1. 
 x Identifier-1 need not describe a group item or an elementary alphanumeric 
 x item. The following rules apply: 
<p>
 x 1.  If the file referenced by file-name-1 is V-format, or a QSAM or SAM 
 x     file with RECORDING MODE 'S' or 'U', a group move will take place. 
<p>
 x 2.  If the file referenced by file-name-1 is F-format, the movement will 
 x     take place according to the rules for the MOVE statement, using, as a 
 x     sending field description, the record that specifies the largest 
 x     number of character positions. If more than one such record exists, 
 x     the sending field record selected will be the one among those records 
 x     that appears first under the description of file-name-1.

       Can be a data item subordinate to a data item that contains an OCCURS 
       clause; that is, it can be a part of a multidimensional table.  In 
       this case, the data description entry must specify an INDEXED BY 
       phrase for each dimension of the table. 
<p>
       Identifier-1 can be an index data item. 
<p>
 x     Identifier-1 can be a DBCS or floating-point data item. 
<p>
       Identifier-1 must refer to all occurrences within the table element; 
       that is, it must not be subscripted or reference-modified. 
<p>
       The Data Division description of identifier-1 must contain an OCCURS 
       clause with the INDEXED BY phrase.  For Format-2, the Data Division 
       description must also contain the KEY IS phrase in its OCCURS clause. 
<p>
       SEARCH statement execution modifies only the value in the index-name 
       associated with identifier-1 (and, if present, of index-name-1 or 
       identifier-2).  Therefore, to search an entire two- to 
       seven-dimensional table, it is necessary to execute a SEARCH statement 
       for each dimension.  Before each execution, SET statements must be 
       executed to reinitialize the associated index-names.

   The Format 1 SEARCH statement executes a serial search beginning at the 
   current index setting.  When the search begins, if the value of the 
   index-name associated with identifier-1 is not greater than the highest 
   possible occurrence number, the following actions take place: 
<p>
   o   The condition(s) in the WHEN phrase are evaluated in the order in 
       which they are written. 
<p>
   o   If none of the conditions is satisfied, the index-name for 
       identifier-1 is increased to correspond to the next table element, and 
       step 1 is repeated. 
<p>
   o   If upon evaluation, one of the WHEN conditions is satisfied, the 
       search is terminated immediately, and the imperative-statement 
       associated with that condition is executed.  The index-name points to 
       the table element that satisfied the condition.  If NEXT SENTENCE is 
       specified, control passes to the statement following the closest 
       period. 
<p>
   o   If the end of the table is reached (that is, the incremented 
       index-name value is greater than the highest possible occurrence 
       number) without the WHEN condition being satisfied, the search is 
       terminated, as described in the next paragraph. 
<p>
   If, when the search begins, the value of the index-name associated with 
   identifier-1 is greater than the highest possible occurrence number, the 
   search immediately ends, and, if specified, the AT END 
   imperative-statement is executed.  If the AT END phrase is omitted, 
   control passes to the next statement after the SEARCH statement.

 | The Format 2 SEARCH ALL statement executes a binary search.  The search 
   index need not be initialized by SET statements, because its setting is 
   varied during the search operation so that its value is at no time less 
   than the value of the first table element, nor ever greater than the value 
   of the last table element.  The index used is always that associated with 
   the first index-name specified in the OCCURS clause. 
<p>
   The results of a SEARCH ALL operation are predictable <B>only</B> when: 
<p>
 | o   The data in the table is ordered in ASCENDING/DESCENDING KEY order 
<p>
   o   The contents of the ASCENDING/DESCENDING keys specified in the WHEN 
       clause provide a unique table reference. 
<p>
   <kbd>identifier-1</kbd> 
       Can be a data item subordinate to a data item that contains an OCCURS 
       clause; that is, it can be a part of a two- to seven-dimensional 
       table.  In this case, the data description entry must specify an 
       INDEXED BY phrase for each dimension of the table. 
<p>
       Identifier-1 must refer to all occurrences within the table element; 
       that is, it must not be subscripted or reference-modified. 
<p>
       Identifier-1 cannot be defined as USAGE IS INDEX. 
<p>
 x     Identifier-1 can be a DBCS item if the ASCENDING/DESCENDING KEY is 
 x     defined as a DBCS item. 
<p>
 x     Identifier-1 cannot be a floating-point data item or a data item 
 x     defined as USAGE IS POINTER. 
<p>
       The Data Division description of identifier-1 must contain an OCCURS 
 |     clause with the INDEXED BY option.  It must also contain the KEY IS 
 |     phrase in its OCCURS clause. 
<p>
   <kbd>AT</kbd> <kbd>END</kbd> 
       The AT END condition exists when the search operation terminates 
       without satisfying the condition specified in any of the associated 
       WHEN phrases. 
<p>
 |     If the AT END condition exists and the AT END phrase is specified, the 
 |     AT END imperative-statement is executed.  If the AT END phrase is <B>not</B> 
 |     specified, control passes to the next statement after the SEARCH 
 |     statement.

<p>
   If the WHEN option <B>can</B> be satisfied, control passes to

<A NAME=3.32.1><H3> 3.32.1   ASCENDING/DESCENDING KEY Phrase</H3></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   This phrase specifies that records are to be processed in ascending or 
   descending sequence (depending on the phrase specified), based on the 
   specified sort keys. 
<p>
   <kbd>data-name-1</kbd> 
       Specifies a KEY data item on which the SORT statement will be based. 
       Each such data-name must identify a data item in a record associated 
       with <B>file-name-1</B>.  The data-names following the word KEY are listed 
       from left to right in the SORT statement in order of decreasing 
       significance without regard to how they are divided into KEY phrases. 
       The left-most data-name is the major key, the next data-name is the 
       next most significant key, and so forth.  The following rules apply: 
<p>
       1.  A specific KEY data item must be physically located in the same 
           position and have the same data format in each input file. 
           However, it need not have the same data-name. 
<p>
       2.  If file-name-1 has more than one record description, then the KEY 
           data items need be described in only one of the record 
           descriptions. 
<p>
       3.  If file-name-1 contains variable-length records, all of the KEY 
           data-items must be contained within the first <I>n</I> character 
 |         positions of the record, where <I>n</I> equals the minimum record size 
           specified for file-name-1. 
<p>
       4.  KEY data items must not contain an OCCURS clause or be subordinate 
           to an item that contains an OCCURS clause. 
<p>
       5.  KEY data items can be qualified. 
<p>
       6.  KEY data items cannot be group items that contain variable 
           occurrence data items. 
<p>
 x     7.  KEY data items can be floating-point items. 
<p>
 x     8.  KEY data items cannot be variably-located. 
<p>
 | If file-name-3 references an indexed file, the first specification of 
 | data-name-1 must be associated with an ASCENDING phrase and the data item 
 | referenced by that data-name-1 must occupy the same character positions in 
 | this record as the data item associated with the major record key for that 
 | file. 
<p>
   The direction of the sorting operation depends on the specification of the 
   ASCENDING or DESCENDING keywords as follows: 
<p>
   o   When ASCENDING is specified, the sequence is from the lowest key value 
       to the highest key value. 
<p>
   o   When DESCENDING is specified, the sequence is from the highest key 
       value to the lowest. 
<p>
   o   If the KEY data item is alphabetic, alphanumeric, alphanumeric-edited, 
       or numeric-edited, the sequence of key values depends on the collating 
       sequence used (see <A HREF=#3.32.3>&quot;COLLATING SEQUENCE Phrase&quot; in topic 3.32.3</A>). 
<p>
 x o   If the KEY is an external floating-point item, the compiler will treat 
 x     the data item as character data, rather than numeric data.  The 
 x     sequence in which the records are sorted depends on the collating 
 x     sequence used. 
<p>
 x o   If the KEY data item is internal floating-point, the sequence of key 
 x     values will be in numeric order. 
<p>
   o   The key comparisons are performed according to the rules for 
       comparison of operands in a relation condition (see &quot;Relation 
       Condition&quot; under <A HREF=#2.8.5>&quot;Conditional Expressions&quot; in topic 2.8.5</A>).

<pre width="80">
<p>
   If the DUPLICATES phrase is specified, and the contents of all the key 
   elements associated with one record are equal to the corresponding key 
   elements in one or more other records, the order of return of these 
   records is as follows: 
<p>
   o   The order of the associated input files as specified in the SORT 
       statement. Within a given file the order is that in which the records 
       are accessed from that file. 
<p>
   o   The order in which these records are released by an input procedure, 
       when an input procedure is specified.

<p>
       When the USING phrase is specified, all the records in file-name-2 
       (that is, the input files) are transferred automatically to 
       file-name-1.  At the time the SORT statement is executed, these files 
       must not be open; the compiler opens, reads, makes records available, 
       and closes these files automatically.  If EXCEPTION/ERROR procedures 
       are specified for these files, the compiler makes the necessary 
       linkage to these procedures. 
<p>
       All input files must be described in FD entries in the Data Division. 
<p>
       If the USING phrase is specified and if file-name-1 contains

       If an input procedure is specified, control is passed to the input 
       procedure before the file referenced by file-name-1 is sequenced by 
       the SORT statement.  The compiler inserts a return mechanism at the 
       end of the last statement in the input procedure. When control passes 
       the last statement in the input procedure, the records that have been 
       released to the file referenced by file-name-1 are sorted.

       The output files. 
<p>
       When the GIVING phrase is specified, all the sorted records in 
       file-name-1 are automatically transferred to the output files 
       (file-name-3). 
<p>
       All output files must be described in FD entries in the Data Division. 
<p>
       If the output files (file-name-3) contain variable-length records, the 
       size of the records contained in file-name-1 must not be less than the 
       smallest record nor greater than the largest record described for the 
       output files. If the output files contain fixed-length records, the 
       size of the records contained in file-name-1 must not be greater than 
       the largest record described for the output files.  For more 
       information, see <cite>VS</cite> <cite>COBOL</cite> <cite>II</cite> <cite>Application</cite> <cite>Programming</cite> <cite>Guide</cite> <cite>for</cite> <cite>MVS</cite> <cite>and</cite>

<p>
       At the time the SORT statement is executed, the output files 
       (file-name-3) must not be open. For each or the output files, the 
       execution of the SORT statement causes the following actions to be 
       taken: 
<p>
       o   The processing of the file is initiated. The initiation is 
           performed as if an OPEN statement with the OUTPUT phrase had been 
           executed. 
<p>
       o   The sorted logical records are returned and written onto the file. 
           Each record is written as if a WRITE statement without any 
           optional phrases had been executed. 
<p>
           For a relative file, the relative key data item for the first 
           record returned contains the value '1'; for the second record 
           returned, the value '2', etc..  After execution of the SORT 
           statement, the content of the relative key data item indicates the 
           last record returned to the file. 
<p>
       o   The processing of the file is terminated.  The termination is 
           performed as if a CLOSE statement without optional phrases had 
           been executed. 
<p>
       These implicit functions are performed such that any associated USE 
       AFTER EXCEPTION/ERROR procedures are executed; however, the execution 
       of such a USE procedure must not cause the execution of any statement 
       manipulating the file referenced by, or accessing the record area 
       associated with, file-name-3.  On the first attempt to write beyond 
       the externally defined boundaries of the file, any USE AFTER STANDARD 
       EXCEPTION/ERROR procedure specified for the file is executed.  If 
       control is returned from that USE procedure or if no such USE 
       procedure is specified, the processing of the file is terminated.

<A NAME=3.32.7><H3> 3.32.7   OUTPUT PROCEDURE Phrase</H3></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   This phrase specifies the name of a procedure that is to select or modify 
   output records from the sorting operation. 
<p>
   <kbd>procedure-name-3</kbd> 
       Specifies the first (or only) section or paragraph in the OUTPUT 
       PROCEDURE. 
<p>
   <kbd>procedure-name-4</kbd> 
       Identifies the last section or paragraph of the OUTPUT PROCEDURE. 
<p>
       The output procedure can consist of any procedure needed to select, 
       modify, or copy the records that are made available one at a time by 
       the RETURN statement in sorted order from the file referenced by 
       file-name-1. The range includes all statements that are executed as 
       the result of a transfer of control by CALL, EXIT, GO TO, and PERFORM 
       statements in the range of the output procedure. The range also 
       includes all statements in declarative procedures that are executed as 
       a result of the execution of statements in the range of the output 
       procedure.  The range of the output procedure must not cause the 
       execution of any MERGE, RELEASE, or SORT statement. 
<p>
       If an output procedure is specified, control passes to it after the 
       file referenced by file-name-1 has been sequenced by the SORT 
       statement.  The compiler inserts a return mechanism at the end of the 
       last statement in the output procedure and when control passes the 
       last statement in the output procedure, the return mechanism provides 
       the termination of the sort and then passes control to the next 
       executable statement after the SORT statement.  Before entering the 
       output procedure, the sort procedure reaches a point at which it can 
       select the next record in sorted order when requested.  The RETURN 
       statements in the output procedure are the requests for the next 
       record. 
<p>
       <B>Note:</B>  The INPUT and OUTPUT PROCEDURE phrases are similar to those for 
       a basic PERFORM statement.  For example, if you name a procedure in an 
       OUTPUT PROCEDURE, that procedure is executed during the sorting 
       operation just as if it were named in a PERFORM statement.  As with 
       the PERFORM statement, execution of the procedure is terminated after 
       the last statement completes execution.  The last statement in an 
       INPUT or OUTPUT PROCEDURE can be the EXIT statement (see <A HREF=#3.14>&quot;EXIT</A> 
       <A HREF=#3.14>Statement&quot; in topic 3.14</A>).

   When the KEY phrase is specified, the key data item used for the 
   comparison is data-name. 
<p>
   When the KEY phrase is not specified, the key data item used for the EQUAL 
   TO comparison is the prime RECORD KEY.

   The file position indicator points to the first record in the file whose

   <kbd>literal</kbd> 
       Can be numeric or nonnumeric, and can be any figurative constant 
       except ALL literal.  If the literal is numeric, it must be an unsigned 
       integer. 
<p>
 x     Can be a signed numeric integer or non-integer literal, but cannot be 
 x     a floating-point literal. 
<p>
 | <B>Note:</B>  STOP literal is an obsolete element and will be deleted from the 
 | next revision of the COBOL 85 Standard. 
<p>
   When STOP literal is specified, the literal is communicated to the 
   operator, and object program execution is suspended.  Program execution is 
   resumed only after operator intervention, and continues at the next 
   executable statement in sequence. 
<p>
   The STOP literal statement is useful for special situations (a special 
   tape or disk must be mounted, a specific daily code must be entered, and 
   so forth) when operator intervention is needed during program execution. 
   However, the ACCEPT and DISPLAY statements are preferred when operator 
   intervention is needed. 
<p>
   When STOP RUN is specified, execution of the object program is terminated, 
   and control is returned to the system.  If a STOP RUN statement appears in 
   a sequence of imperative statements within a sentence, it must be the last 
   or only statement in the sequence. 
<p>
 x The STOP RUN statement does not have to be the last statement in a 
 x sequence, but the statements following the STOP RUN will not be executed. 
<p>
   The STOP RUN statement closes <B>all</B> files defined in any of the programs 
   comprising the run unit. 
<p>
   For use of the STOP RUN statement in calling and called programs, see the

<p>

       control is transferred to the end of the STRING statement or, if the 
       ON OVERFLOW phrase is specified, to imperative-statement-1. 
<p>
       If control is transferred to imperative-statement-1, execution

<pre width="80">
<p>
   When the STRING statement is executed, data is transferred from the 
   sending fields to the receiving field.  The order in which sending fields 
   are processed is the order in which they are specified.  The following 
   rules apply: 
<p>
   o   Characters from the sending fields are transferred to the receiving 
       field, according to the rules for alphanumeric to alphanumeric 
       elementary moves, except that no space filling is provided (see <A HREF=#3.22>&quot;MOVE</A> 
       <A HREF=#3.22>Statement&quot; in topic 3.22</A>). 
<p>
   o   When DELIMITED BY identifier/literal is specified, the contents of 
       each sending item are transferred, character-by-character, beginning 
       with the leftmost character and continuing until either: 
<p>
       -   A delimiter for this sending field is reached (the delimiter 
           itself is not transferred), or 
<p>
       -   The rightmost character of this sending field has been 
           transferred. 
<p>
 x     <B>Note:</B>  This element may exhibit different behavior when the CMPR2 
 x     compiler option is in effect.  For more information, see <cite>VS</cite> <cite>COBOL</cite> <cite>II</cite> 
 x     <cite>Migration</cite> <cite>Guide</cite> <cite>for</cite> <cite>MVS</cite> <cite>and</cite> <cite>CMS</cite> or <cite>VS</cite> <cite>COBOL</cite> <cite>II</cite> <cite>Migration</cite> <cite>Guide</cite> <cite>for</cite> 
 x     <cite>VSE.</cite> 
<p>
   o   When DELIMITED BY SIZE identifier is specified, each entire sending 
       field is transferred to the receiving field. 
<p>
   o   When the receiving field is filled, or when all the sending fields 
       have been processed, the operation is ended. 
<p>
   o   When the POINTER phrase is specified, an explicit pointer field is 
       available to the COBOL user to control placement of data in the 
       receiving field.  The user must set the explicit pointer's initial 
       value, which must not be less than 1 and not more than the character 
       count of the receiving field.  (Note that the pointer field must be 
       defined as a field large enough to contain a value equal to the length 
       of the receiving field plus 1; this precludes arithmetic overflow when 
       the system updates the pointer at the end of the transfer.) 
<p>
   o   When the POINTER phrase is not specified, no pointer is available to 
       the user.  However, a conceptual implicit pointer with an initial 
       value of 1 is used by the system. 
<p>
   o   Conceptually, when the STRING statement is executed, the initial 
       pointer value (explicit or implicit) is the first character position 
       within the receiving field into which data is to be transferred. 
       Beginning at that position, data is then positioned, 
       character-by-character, from left to right.  After each character is 
       positioned, the explicit or implicit pointer is increased by 1.  The 
       value in the pointer field is changed only in this manner.  At the end 
       of processing, the pointer value always indicates a value equal to 1 
       character beyond the last character transferred into the receiving 
       field. 
<p>
 | o   If identifier-1 or identifier-2 occupies the same storage area as 
 |     identifier-3 or identifier-4, or if identifier-3 and identifier-4 
 |     occupy the same storage area, then undefined results will occur, even 
 |     if the identifiers are defined by the same data description entry. 
<p>
<p>
   <B>Note:</B>  Any subscript, reference modification, variable-length, or variable 
   location calculations are performed only once, at the beginning of the 
   execution of the STRING statement.  Therefore, if identifier-3 or 
   identifier-4 is used as a subscript or reference-modifier in the STRING 
   statement, or affects the length or location of any of the identifiers in 
   the STRING statement, these values are determined at the beginning of the 
   STRING statement, and are <B>not</B> affected by any results of the STRING 
   statement. 
<p>
   After STRING statement execution is completed, only that part of the 
   receiving field into which data was transferred is changed.  The rest of 
   the receiving field contains the data that was present before this 
   execution of the STRING statement. 
<p>
   When the following STRING statement is executed, the results obtained are 
   illustrated in Figure 17.

           1-character nonnumeric literal. 
<p>
   <kbd>ALL</kbd> 
       One or more contiguous occurrences of any delimiters are treated as if 
       they were only one occurrence, and this one occurrence is moved to the 
       delimiter receiving field (if specified).  The delimiting characters 
 x     in the sending field are treated as an elementary alphanumeric or DBCS 
       item and are moved into the current delimiter receiving field, 
       according to the rules of the MOVE statement. 
<p>
       When DELIMITED BY ALL is <B>not</B> specified, and two or more contiguous 
       occurrences of any delimiter are encountered, the current data 
       receiving field is filled with spaces or zeros, according to the 
       description of the data receiving field. 
<p>
   If a delimiter contains two or more characters, it is recognized as a 
   delimiter only if the delimiting characters are contiguous, and in the 
   sequence specified in the sending field. 
<p>
   When two or more delimiters are specified, an OR condition exists, and 
   each non-overlapping occurrence of any one of the delimiters is recognized 
   in the sending field in the sequence specified.  For example, if DELIMITED 
   BY &quot;AB&quot; or &quot;BC&quot; is specified, then an occurrence of either AB or BC in the 
   sending field is considered a delimiter; an occurrence of ABC is 
   considered an occurrence of AB.  The data-count fields, the pointer field, 
   and the field-count field must each be an integer item without the symbol 
   P in the PICTURE character-string.

<A NAME=3.37.7><H3> 3.37.7   Data Flow</H3></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   When the UNSTRING statement is initiated, data is transferred from the 
   sending field to the current data receiving field, according to the 
   following rules (the current data receiving field is identifier-4): 
<p>
   1.  If the POINTER phrase is not specified, the sending field 
       character-string is examined, beginning with the leftmost character. 
       If the POINTER phrase is specified, the field is examined, beginning 
       at the relative character position specified by the value in the 
       pointer field. 
<p>
   2.  If the DELIMITED BY phrase is specified, the examination proceeds from 
       left to right, character-by-character, until a delimiter is 
       encountered.  If the end of the sending field is reached before a 
       delimiter is found, the examination ends with the last character in 
       the sending field.  If there are more receiving fields, the next one 
       is selected, otherwise, an overflow condition occurs. 
<p>
   3.  If the DELIMITED BY phrase is not specified, the number of characters 
       examined is equal to the size of the current data receiving field, 
       which depends on its data category: 
<p>
       a.  If the receiving field is alphanumeric or alphabetic, the number 
           of characters examined is equal to the number of characters in the 
           current receiving field. 
<p>
       b.  If the receiving field is numeric, the number of characters 
           examined is equal to the number of characters in the integer 
           portion of the current receiving field. 
<p>
       c.  If the receiving field is described with the SIGN IS SEPARATE 
           clause, the number of characters examined is one less than the 
           size of the current receiving field. 
<p>
       d.  If the receiving field is described as a variable-length data 
           item, the number of characters examined is determined by the size 
           of the current receiving field at the beginning of the UNSTRING 
           operation. 
<p>
   4.  The examined characters (excluding any delimiter characters) are 
       treated as an alphanumeric elementary item, and are moved into the 
       current data receiving field, according to the rules for the MOVE 
       statement (see <A HREF=#3.22>&quot;MOVE Statement&quot; in topic 3.22</A>). 
<p>
   5.  If the DELIMITER IN phrase is specified, the delimiting characters in 
       the sending field are treated as an elementary alphanumeric item and 
       are moved to the current delimiter receiving field, according to the 
       rules for the MOVE statement.  If the delimiting condition is the end 
       of the sending field, the current delimiter receiving field is filled 
       with spaces. 
<p>
   6.  If the COUNT IN phrase is specified, a value equal to the number of 
       examined characters (excluding any delimiters) is moved into the data 
       count field, according to the rules for an elementary move. 
<p>
   7.  If the DELIMITED BY phrase is specified, the sending field is further 
       examined, beginning with the first character to the right of the 
       delimiter. 
<p>
   8.  If the DELIMITED BY phrase is not specified, the sending field is 
       further examined, beginning with the first character to the right of 
       the last character examined. 
<p>
   9.  For each succeeding data receiving field, the preceding procedure is 
       repeated either until all the characters in the sending field have 
       been transferred, or until there are no more unfilled data receiving 
       fields. 
<p>
   10. When the POINTER phrase is specified,  the value of the pointer field 
       behaves as if it were increased by 1 for each examined character in 
       the sending field.  When this execution of the UNSTRING statement is 
       completed, the pointer field contains a value equal to its initial 
       value, plus the number of characters examined in the sending field. 
<p>
   11. When the TALLYING phrase is specified, then, when this execution of 
       the UNSTRING statement is completed, the field-count field contains a 
       value equal to the initial value, plus the number of data receiving 
       areas acted upon. 
<p>
   <B>Note:</B>   Any subscript, reference modification, variable-length, or 
   variable location calculations are performed only once, at the beginning 
   of the execution of the UNSTRING statement.  Therefore, if identifier-4, 
   identifier-5, identifier-6, identifier-7, or identifier-8 is used as a 
   subscript or reference-modifier in the UNSTRING statement, or affects the 
   length or location of any of the identifiers in the UNSTRING statement, 
   then these values are determined at the beginning of the UNSTRING 
   statement, and are <B>not</B> affected by any results of the UNSTRING statement. 
<p>

   Figure 18.

       qualified.  It must not be associated with a sort or merge file. 
<p>
 x     Record-name-1 can be a floating-point or DBCS data item.  If

       Identifier-1 and record-name-1 must not refer to the same storage 
       area. 
<p>
 x     Identifier-1 can be a floating-point or DBCS data item. 
<p>

<p>
   The maximum record size for the file is established at the time the file 
   is created, and cannot subsequently be changed. 
<p>
   After the WRITE statement is executed, the logical record is no longer 
   available in record-name-1, unless: 
<p>
   o   The associated file is named in a SAME RECORD AREA clause (in which 
       case, the record is also available as a record of the other files 
       named in the SAME RECORD AREA clause), or 
<p>
   o   The WRITE statement is unsuccessful because of a boundary violation. 
<p>
   In either of these two cases, the logical record is still available in 
   record-name-1. 
<p>
   The file position indicator is not affected by execution of the WRITE 
   statement. 
<p>
   The number of character positions required to store the record in a file 
   may or may not be the same as the number of character positions defined by 
   the logical description of that record in the COBOL program.  (See

<A NAME=3.38.1.1><H4> 3.38.1.1   ADVANCING Phrase</H4></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
   The ADVANCING phrase controls positioning of the output record on the 
   page. 
<p>
   When this phrase is specified, the following rules apply: 
<p>
   1.  When BEFORE ADVANCING is specified, the line is printed before the 
       page is advanced. 
<p>
   2.  When AFTER ADVANCING is specified, the page is advanced before the 
       line is printed. 
<p>
   3.  When identifier-2 is specified, the page is advanced the number of 
       lines equal to the current value in identifier-2.  Identifier-2 must 
       name an elementary integer data item. 
<p>
   4.  When integer is specified, the page is advanced the number of lines 
       equal to the value of integer. 
<p>
   5.  Integer or the value in identifier-2 can be zero. 
<p>
 | 6.  When mnemonic-name-1 is specified, a skip to channels 1 through 12, or 
 |     space suppression, takes place.  Mnemonic-name-1 must be equated with 
 |     environment-name-1 in the SPECIAL-NAMES paragraph.  For information on 
 |     possible values for mnemonic-name-1 and environment-name-1 see topic 
 |     <A HREF=#2.3.3>2.3.3</A>. 
<p>
 x     The mnemonic-name-1 phrase can also be specified for stacker selection 
 x     with a card punch file.  When using stacker selection, WRITE AFTER 
 x     ADVANCING must be used. 
<p>
   7.  When PAGE is specified, the record is printed on the logical page 
       BEFORE or AFTER (depending on the phrase used) the device is 
       positioned to the next logical page.  If PAGE has no meaning for the 
       device used, then BEFORE or AFTER (depending on the phrase specified) 
       ADVANCING 1 LINE is provided. 
<p>
       If the FD entry contains a LINAGE clause, the repositioning is to the 
       first printable line of the next page, as specified in that clause. 
       If the LINAGE clause is omitted, the repositioning is to line 1 of the 
       next succeeding page. 
<p>
   The ADVANCING phrase of the WRITE statement, or the presence of a LINAGE 
   clause on the file, causes a carriage control character to be generated in 
   the record that is If the corresponding file connector is EXTERNAL, all 
   file connectors within the run unit must be defined such that carriage 
   control characters will be generated for records that are written.  That 
   is, if all the files have a LINAGE clause, some of the programs can use 
   the WRITE statement with the ADVANCING phrase and other programs can use 
   the WRITE statement without the ADVANCING phrase.  However, if none of the 
   files has a LINAGE clause, then if any of the programs use the WRITE 
   statement with the ADVANCING phrase, all of the programs in the run unit 
   that have a WRITE statement must use the WRITE statement with the 
   ADVANCING phrase. 
<p>
<p>
   <I>LINAGE-COUNTER</I> <I>Rules</I>:  If the LINAGE clause is specified for this file, 
   the associated LINAGE-COUNTER special register is modified during the 
   execution of the WRITE statement, according to the following rules: 
<p>
   1.  If ADVANCING PAGE is specified, LINAGE-COUNTER is reset to 1. 
<p>
   2.  If ADVANCING identifier-2 or integer is specified, LINAGE-COUNTER is 
       increased by the value in identifier-2 or integer. 
<p>
   3.  If the ADVANCING phrase is omitted, LINAGE-COUNTER is increased by 1. 
<p>
   4.  When the device is repositioned to the first available line of a new 
       page, LINAGE-COUNTER is reset to 1. 
<p>
   When this phrase is omitted, automatic line advancing is provided, as if 
   the user had written AFTER ADVANCING 1 LINE. 
<p>
 x <B>Note:</B>  If you use the ADV compiler option, the compiler adds 1 byte to the 
 x record length in order to allow for the control character.  If in your 
 x record definition you already reserve the first byte for the control 
 x character, you should use the NOADV option.  For files defined with the 
 x LINAGE clause, the NOADV option has no effect.  The compiler processes 
 x these files as if the ADV option were specified.

<A NAME=3.38.1.2><H4> 3.38.1.2   END-OF-PAGE Phrases</H4></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   When END-OF-PAGE is specified, and the logical end of the printed page is 
   reached during execution of the WRITE statement, the END-OF-PAGE 
   imperative-statement is executed.  When the END-OF-PAGE phrase is 
   specified, the FD entry for this file must contain a LINAGE clause.  The 
   logical end of the printed page is specified in the associated LINAGE 
   clause. 
<p>
   An END-OF-PAGE condition is reached when execution of a WRITE END-OF-PAGE 
   statement causes printing or spacing within the footing area of a page 
   body.  This occurs when execution of such a WRITE statement causes the 
   value in the LINAGE-COUNTER special register to equal or exceed the value 
   specified in the WITH FOOTING phrase of the LINAGE clause.  The WRITE 
   statement is executed, and then the END-OF-PAGE imperative-statement is 
   executed. 
<p>
   An automatic page overflow condition is reached whenever the execution of 
   any given WRITE statement (with or without the END-OF-PAGE phrase) cannot 
   be completely executed within the current page body.  This occurs when a 
   WRITE statement, if executed, would cause the value in the LINAGE-COUNTER 
   to exceed the number of lines for the page body specified in the LINAGE 
   clause.  In this case, the line is printed BEFORE or AFTER (depending on 
   the option specified) the device is repositioned to the first printable 
   line on the next logical page, as specified in the LINAGE clause.  If the 
   END-OF-PAGE phrase is specified, the END-OF-PAGE imperative-statement is 
   then executed. 
<p>
   If the WITH FOOTING phrase of the LINAGE clause is not specified, the 
   automatic page overflow condition exists because no end-of-page condition 
   (as distinct from the page overflow condition) can be detected. 
<p>
   If the WITH FOOTING phrase is specified, but the execution of a given 
   WRITE statement would cause the LINAGE-COUNTER to exceed both the footing 
   value and the page body value specified in the LINAGE clause, then both 
   the end-of-page condition and the automatic page overflow condition occur 
   simultaneously. 
<p>
   The keywords END-OF-PAGE and EOP are equivalent. 
<p>
   The ADVANCING PAGE and END-OF-PAGE phrases must not both be specified in a 
   single WRITE statement. 
<p>
 x The ADVANCING PAGE and END-OF-PAGE phrases can both be specified in a 
 x single WRITE statement.

<p>
 x When the INVALID KEY phrase is specified and an attempt is made to write 
 x beyond the externally defined boundaries of the file, the INVALID KEY 
 x imperative statement is executed (See <A HREF=#2.8.9.1.1>Table 30 in topic 2.8.9.1.1</A>). 
<p>
   When an attempt is made to write beyond the externally defined boundaries 
   of the file, WRITE statement execution is unsuccessful and an 
   EXCEPTION/ERROR condition exists.  The status key, if specified, is 
   updated, and, if an explicit or implicit EXCEPTION/ERROR procedure is 
   specified for the file, the procedure is executed; if no such procedure is 
   specified, the results are unpredictable.

   attempt to write beyond the limits of the card results in abnormal 
   termination of the job; thus, the END-OF-PAGE phrase cannot be specified. 
<p>
   Depending on the capabilities of the specific IBM 3525 model in use, the 
   print file can be either a 2-line print file or a multiline print file. 
   Up to 64 characters can be printed on each line. 
<p>
   o   For a 2-line print file, the lines are printed on line 1 (top edge of 
       card) and line 3 (between rows 11 and 12).  Line control cannot be 
       specified.  Automatic spacing is provided. 
<p>
   o   For a multiline print file, up to 25 lines of characters can be 
       printed.  Line control can be specified.  If line control is not 
       specified, automatic spacing is provided. 
<p>
   Line control is specified by issuing WRITE AFTER ADVANCING statements for 
   the print function file.  If line control is used for one such statement, 
   it must be used for all other WRITE statements issued to the file.  The 
   maximum number of printable characters, including any space characters, is 
   64.  Such WRITE statements must not specify space suppression. 
<p>
   Identifier and integer have the same meanings they have for other WRITE 
   AFTER ADVANCING statements.  However, such WRITE statements must not 
   increase the line position on the card beyond the card limit, or abnormal 
   termination results. 
<p>
   The mnemonic-name option of the WRITE AFTER ADVANCING statement can also 
   be specified.  In the SPECIAL-NAMES paragraph, the environment-names can 
   be associated with the mnemonic-names, as follows:

 x continuation is not allowed.  The statement can be terminated with a 
 x period. 
<p>
 x The *CONTROL and *CBL statements must be embedded in a source program. 
 x For example, in the case of batch jobs the *CONTROL and *CBL statements 
 x must be placed between the PROCESS (CBL) statement and the end of the 
 x program (or END PROGRAM header, if specified).

<p>
 x The requested options are handled in the following manner: 
<p>
 x 1.  If an option or its negation appears more than once in a *CONTROL 
 x     statement, the last occurrence of the option word is used. 
<p>
 x 2.  If the CORRESPONDING option has been requested as a parameter to the 
 x     compiler, then a *CONTROL statement with the negation of the option 
 x     word must precede the portions of the source program for which listing 
 x     output is to be inhibited.  Listing output then resumes when a 
 x     *CONTROL statement with the affirmative option word is encountered. 
<p>
 x 3.  If the negation of the CORRESPONDING option has been requested as a 
 x     parameter to the compiler, then that listing is <B>always</B> inhibited. 
<p>
 x 4.  The *CONTROL statement is in effect only within the source program in 
 x     which it is written, including any contained programs.  It does not 
 x     remain in effect across batch compiles of two or more COBOL source 
 x     programs.

<A NAME=4.4><H2> 4.4   COPY Statement</H2></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   The COPY statement is a library statement that places prewritten text in a 
   COBOL program. 
<p>
   Prewritten source program entries can be included in a source program at 
   compile time.  Thus, an installation can use standard file descriptions, 
   record descriptions, or procedures without recoding them.  These entries 
   and procedures can then be saved in user-created libraries; they can then 
   be included in the source program by means of the COPY statement. 
<p>
   Compilation of the source program containing COPY statements is logically 
   equivalent to processing all COPY statements before processing the 
   resulting source program. 
<p>
   The effect of processing a COPY statement is that the library text 
   associated with text-name is copied into the source program, logically 
   replacing the entire COPY statement, beginning with the word COPY and 
   ending with the period, inclusive.  When the REPLACING phrase is not 
   specified, the library text is copied unchanged.

 x     formation of a program-name in the outermost program (see <A HREF=#2.2.1>&quot;PROGRAM-ID</A> 
 x     <A HREF=#2.2.1>Paragraph&quot; in topic 2.2.1</A>). 
<p>
   The uniqueness of text-name and library-name is determined after the 
   formation and conversion rules for a program-name have been applied. 
<p>
   If more than one COBOL library is available during compilation, text-name 
   must be qualified by the library-name of the library in which it resides. 
<p>
 x Text-name need not be qualified.  If text-name is not qualified, a 
 x library-name of SYSLIB is assumed. 
<p>
   <kbd>operand-1,</kbd> <kbd>operand-2</kbd> 
       Can be either pseudo-text, an identifier, a literal, or a COBOL word 
       (except COPY). 
<p>
   Each COPY statement must be preceded by a space and ended with a separator 
   period. 
<p>
   A COPY statement can appear in the source program anywhere a character 
   string or a separator can appear; however, a COPY statement must not be 
   specified within a COPY statement.  The resulting copied text must not 
   contain a COPY statement. 
<p>
 x COPY statements can be nested.  However, nested COPY statements cannot 
 x contain the REPLACING phrase, and a COPY statement with the REPLACING 
 x phrase cannot contain nested COPY statements. 
<p>
 x A COPY statement cannot cause recursion.  That is, a COPY member can be 
 x named only once in a set of nested COPY statements until the end-of-file 
 x for that COPY member is reached.  For example, assume that the source 
 x program contains the statement: 
<p>
 x   <samp>COPY</samp> <samp>X.</samp> 
<p>
 x and library member X contains the statement: 
<p>
 x   <samp>COPY</samp> <samp>Y.</samp> 
<p>
 x In this case, the library member Y must not have a <tt>COPY</tt> <tt>X</tt> or a <tt>COPY</tt> <tt>Y</tt> 
 x statement. 
<p>
   Debugging lines are permitted within library text and pseudo-text.  Text 
   words within a debugging line participate in the matching rules as if the 
   D did not appear in the indicator area.  A debugging line is specified 
   within pseudo-text if the debugging line begins in the source program 
   after the opening pseudo-text delimiter but before the matching closing 
   pseudo-text delimiter. 
<p>
 | If additional lines are introduced into the source program as a result of 
 | a COPY statement, each text word introduced appears on a debugging line if 
 | the COPY statement begins on a debugging line or if the text word being 
 | introduced appears on a debugging line in Library text.  When a text word 
 | specified in the BY phrase is introduced, it appears on a debugging line 
 | if the first library text word being replaced is specified on a debugging 
 | line. 
<p>
   When a COPY statement is specified on a debugging line, the copied text is 
   treated as though it appeared on a debugging line, except that comment 
   lines in the text appear as comment lines in the resulting source program. 
<p>
   If the word COPY appears in a comment-entry, or in the place where a 
   comment-entry can appear, it is considered part of the comment-entry. 
<p>
   After all COPY and REPLACE statements have been processed, a debugging 
   line will be considered to have all the characteristics of a comment line, 
   if the WITH DEBUGGING MODE clause is not specified in the SOURCE-COMPUTER 
   paragraph. 
<p>
   Comment lines or blank lines can occur in library text.  Comment lines or 
   blank lines appearing in library text are copied into the resultant source 
   program unchanged with the following exception:  a comment line or blank 
   line in library text is not copied if that comment line or blank line 
   appears within the sequence of text words that match operand-1 (refer to 
   &quot;Replacement and Comparison Rules&quot; on topic <A HREF=#4.4.3>4.4.3</A>). 
<p>
 x Lines containing *CONTROL (*CBL), EJECT, SKIP1/2/3, or TITLE statements 
 x can occur in library text.  Such lines are treated as comment lines during 
 x COPY statement processing. 
<p>
   The syntactic correctness of the entire COBOL source program cannot be 
   determined until all COPY and REPLACE statements have been completely 
   processed, because the syntactic correctness of the library text cannot be 
   independently determined. 
<p>
   Library text copied from the library is placed into the same area of the 
   resultant program as it is in the library.  Library text must conform to 
   the rules for standard COBOL format. 
<p>
   <B>Note:</B>  Characters outside the standard COBOL character set must not appear 
   in library text or pseudo-text, other than as part of nonnumeric literals, 
   comment lines, or comment-entries. 
<p>
 x DBCS words and DBCS literals are allowed in library text and pseudo-text.

<pre width="80">
<p>
   In the discussion that follows, each <B>operand</B> can consist of one of the 
   following: 
<p>
   o   Pseudo-text 
   o   An identifier 
   o   A literal 
   o   A COBOL word (except COPY) 
<p>
   When the REPLACING phrase is specified, the library text is copied, and 
   each properly matched occurrence of operand-1 within the library text is 
   replaced by the associated operand-2. 
<p>
   <kbd>pseudo-text</kbd> 
       A sequence of character-strings and/or separators bounded by, but not 
       including, pseudo-text-1 delimiters (==).  Both characters of each 
       pseudo-text-1 delimiter must appear on one line; however, 
       character-strings within pseudo-text-1 can be continued. 
<p>
 |     Any individual character-string within pseudo-text-1 can be up to 323 
 |     characters long.  Keep in mind that a character-string must be 
 |     delimited by separators. For more information, see <A HREF=#1.1>&quot;Characters&quot; in</A> 
 |     <A HREF=#1.1>topic 1.1</A>. 
<p>
 |     Pseudo-text-1 refers to pseudo-text when used for operand-1, and 
 |     pseudo-text-2 refers to pseudo-text when used for operand-2. 
<p>
       Pseudo-text-1 must not be null, nor can it consist solely of the space 
       character, separator comma, separator semicolon, and/or of comment 
       lines.  Beginning and ending blanks are not included in the text 
       comparison process.  Embedded blanks are used in the text comparison 
       process to indicate multiple text words. 
<p>
       Pseudo-text must not contain the word <tt>COPY</tt>. 
<p>
 x     Pseudo-text-1 can consist solely of the separator comma or separator 
 x     semicolon. 
<p>
       Pseudo-text-2 can be null; it can consist solely of space characters 
       and/or comment lines.  Each text word in pseudo-text-2 that is to be 
       copied into the program is placed in the same area of the resultant 
       program as the area in which it appears in pseudo-text-2. 
<p>
 x     Pseudo-text can contain DBCS character-strings.  Pseudo-text 
 x     containing DBCS characters cannot be continued across lines. 
<p>
   <kbd>identifier</kbd> 
       Can be defined in any Data Division section. 
<p>
   <kbd>literal</kbd> 
       Can be numeric or nonnumeric. 
<p>
 x     Literal can be a DBCS literal. 
<p>
   <kbd>word</kbd> 
       Can be any single COBOL word (except COPY). 
<p>
   For purposes of matching, each identifier-1, literal-1, or word-1 is 
   treated, respectively, as pseudo-text containing only identifier-1, 
   literal-1, or word-1. 
<p>
 x Either operand, or both, can be a DBCS data-name or DBCS literal.  DBCS 
 x data-names can be from 1 to 14 DBCS characters in length; DBCS literals 
 x can be a maximum of 28 DBCS characters long.  DBCS data-names and literals 
 x cannot be continued across lines.

<A NAME=4.4.3><H3> 4.4.3   Replacement and Comparison Rules</H3></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   1.  Arithmetic and logical operators are considered text words and can be 
       replaced only through the pseudo-text option. 
<p>
   2.  When a figurative constant is operand-1, it will match only if it 
       appears exactly as it is specified.  For example, if ALL &quot;AB&quot; is 
       specified in the library text, then &quot;ABAB&quot; is not considered a match; 
       only ALL &quot;AB&quot; is considered a match. 
<p>
   3.  When replacing a PICTURE character-string, the pseudo-text option 
       should be used; to avoid ambiguities, pseudo-text-1 should specify the 
       entire PICTURE clause, including the keyword PICTURE or PIC. 
<p>
   4.  Any separator comma, semicolon, and/or space preceding the leftmost 
       word in the library text is copied into the source program.  Beginning 
       with the leftmost library text word and the first operand-1 specified 
       in the REPLACING option, the entire REPLACING operand that precedes 
       the keyword BY is compared to an equivalent number of contiguous 
       library text words. 
<p>
   5.  Operand-1 matches the library text if, and only if, the ordered 
       sequence of text words in operand-1 is equal, character for character, 
       to the ordered sequence of library words.  For matching purposes, each 
       occurrence of a comma or semicolon separator and each sequence of one 
 x     or more space separators is considered to be a single space.  However, 
 x     when operand-1 consists solely of a separator comma or semicolon, it 
 x     participates in the match as a text-word (in this case, the space 
 x     following the comma or semicolon separator can be omitted). 
<p>
   6.  If no match occurs, the comparison is repeated with each successive 
       operand-1, if specified, until either a match is found or there are no 
       further REPLACING operands. 
<p>
   7.  Whenever a match occurs between operand-1 and the library text, the 
       associated operand-2 is copied into the source program. 
<p>
   8.  When all operands have been compared and no match is found, the 
       leftmost library text word is copied into the source program. 
<p>
   9.  The next successive uncopied library text word is then considered to 
       be the leftmost text word, and the comparison process is repeated, 
       beginning with the first operand-1.  The process continues until the 
       rightmost library text word has been compared. 
<p>
   10. Comment lines or blank lines occurring in the library text and in 
       pseudo-text-1 are ignored for purposes of matching; and the sequence 
       of text words in the library text and in pseudo-text-1 is determined 
       by the rules for reference format.  Comment lines or blank lines 
       appearing in pseudo-text-2 are copied into the resultant program 
       unchanged whenever pseudo-text-2 is placed into the source program as 
       a result of text replacement.  Comment lines or blank lines appearing 
       in library text are copied into the resultant source program unchanged 
       with the following exception:  a comment line or blank line in library 
       text is not copied if that comment line or blank line appears within 
       the sequence of text words that match pseudo-text-1. 
<p>
   11. Text words, after replacement, are placed in the source program 
       according to standard COBOL format rules. 
<p>
   12. COPY REPLACING  does not affect the EJECT, SKIP1/2/3, or TITLE 
       compiler-directing statements.  When text words are placed in the 
       source program, additional spaces are introduced only between text 
       words where there already exists a space (including the assumed space 
       between source lines). 
<p>
   Sequences of code (such as file and data descriptions, error and exception 
   routines, etc.) that are common to a number of programs can be saved in a 
   library, and then used in conjunction with the COPY statement.  If naming 
   conventions are established for such common code, then the REPLACING 
   phrase need not be specified.  If the names will change from one program 
   to another, then the REPLACING phrase can be used to supply meaningful 
   names for this program. 
<p>
<p>
   <I>Example</I> <I>1</I>:  In this example, the library text PAYLIB consists of the 
   following Data Division entries: 
<p>
     <samp>01</samp>  <samp>A.</samp> 
       <samp>02</samp>  <samp>B</samp>    <samp>PIC</samp> <samp>S99.</samp>

<p>
   The programmer can use the COPY statement in the Data Division of a 
   program as follows: 
<p>
         <samp>COPY</samp> <samp>PAYLIB.</samp> 
<p>
   In this program, the library text is copied; the resulting text is treated 
   as if it had been written as follows: 
<p>
     <samp>01</samp>  <samp>A.</samp> 
       <samp>02</samp>  <samp>B</samp>    <samp>PIC</samp> <samp>S99.</samp> 
       <samp>02</samp>  <samp>C</samp>    <samp>PIC</samp> <samp>S9(5)V99.</samp> 
       <samp>02</samp>  <samp>D</samp>    <samp>PIC</samp> <samp>S9(4)</samp>  <samp>OCCURS</samp> <samp>1</samp> <samp>TO</samp> <samp>52</samp> <samp>TIMES</samp>  <samp>DEPENDING</samp> <samp>ON</samp> <samp>B</samp> <samp>OF</samp> <samp>A.</samp> 
<p>
<p>
   <I>Example</I> <I>2</I>:  To change some (or all) of the names within the library text, 
   the programmer can use the REPLACING phrase: 
<p>
       <samp>COPY</samp> <samp>PAYLIB</samp> <samp>REPLACING</samp>  <samp>A</samp> <samp>BY</samp> <samp>PAYROLL</samp> 
                              <samp>B</samp> <samp>BY</samp> <samp>PAY-CODE</samp> 
                              <samp>C</samp> <samp>BY</samp> <samp>GROSS-PAY</samp> 
                              <samp>D</samp> <samp>BY</samp> <samp>HOURS.</samp> 
<p>
   In this program, the library text is copied; the resulting text is treated 
   as if it had been written as follows: 
<p>
     <samp>01</samp>  <samp>PAYROLL.</samp> 
       <samp>02</samp>  <samp>PAY-CODE</samp>   <samp>PIC</samp> <samp>S99.</samp> 
       <samp>02</samp>  <samp>GROSS-PAY</samp>  <samp>PIC</samp> <samp>S9(5)V99.</samp> 
       <samp>02</samp>  <samp>HOURS</samp>      <samp>PIC</samp> <samp>S9(4)</samp>  <samp>OCCURS</samp> <samp>1</samp> <samp>TO</samp> <samp>52</samp> <samp>TIMES</samp> 
                      <samp>DEPENDING</samp> <samp>ON</samp> <samp>PAY-CODE</samp> <samp>OF</samp> <samp>PAYROLL.</samp> 
<p>
   The changes shown are made only for this program.  The text, as it appears 
   in the library, remains unchanged. 
<p>
<p>
   <I>Example</I> <I>3</I>:  If the following conventions are followed in library text, 
   then parts of names (for example the prefix portion of data-names) can be 
   changed with the REPLACING phrase. 
<p>
   In this example, the library text PAYLIB consists of the following Data 
   Division entries: 
<p>
     <samp>01</samp>  <samp>:</samp><samp>TAG:.</samp> 
       <samp>02</samp>  <samp>:</samp><samp>TAG:-WEEK</samp>       <samp>PIC</samp> <samp>S99.</samp> 
       <samp>02</samp>  <samp>:</samp><samp>TAG:-GROSS-PAY</samp>  <samp>PIC</samp> <samp>S9(5)V99.</samp> 
       <samp>02</samp>  <samp>:</samp><samp>TAG:-HOURS</samp>      <samp>PIC</samp> <samp>S999</samp>  <samp>OCCURS</samp> <samp>1</samp> <samp>TO</samp> <samp>52</samp> <samp>TIMES</samp> 
           <samp>DEPENDING</samp> <samp>ON</samp> <samp>:</samp><samp>TAG:-WEEK</samp> <samp>OF</samp> <samp>:</samp><samp>TAG:.</samp> 
<p>
   The programmer can use the COPY statement in the Data Division of a 
   program as follows: 
<p>
     <samp>COPY</samp> <samp>PAYLIB</samp> <samp>REPLACING</samp> <samp>==:</samp><samp>TAG:==</samp> <samp>BY</samp> <samp>==Payroll==.</samp> 
<p>
   <B>Note:</B>  It is important to notice in this example the required use of 
   colons or parentheses as delimiters in the library text.  Colons are 
   recommended for clarity because parentheses may be used for a subscript, 
   for instance in a table. 
<p>
   In this program, the library text is copied; the resulting text is treated 
   as if it had been written as follows: 
<p>
     <samp>01</samp>  <samp>PAYROLL.</samp> 
       <samp>02</samp>  <samp>PAYROLL-WEEK</samp>        <samp>PIC</samp> <samp>S99.</samp> 
       <samp>02</samp>  <samp>PAYROLL-GROSS-PAY</samp>   <samp>PIC</samp> <samp>S9(5)V99.</samp> 
       <samp>02</samp>  <samp>PAYROLL-HOURS</samp>       <samp>PIC</samp> <samp>S999</samp>  <samp>OCCURS</samp> <samp>1</samp> <samp>TO</samp> <samp>52</samp> <samp>TIMES</samp> 
           <samp>DEPENDING</samp> <samp>ON</samp> <samp>PAYROLL-WEEK</samp> <samp>OF</samp> <samp>PAYROLL.</samp> 
<p>
   The changes shown are made only for this program.  The text, as it appears 
   in the library, remains unchanged.

<p>
 x <kbd>sequence-number-field</kbd> 
 x     Each number must be equal to a sequence-number in the BASIS source

 x     assigns in columns 1 through 6 of the COBOL coding form.  The numbers 
 x     referenced in the sequence-number-fields of any INSERT or DELETE 
 x     statements must always be specified in ascending numeric order. 
<p>
 x     The sequence-number-field must be any one of the following: 
<p>
 x     o   A single number 
<p>
 x     o   A series of single numbers 
<p>

<pre width="80">
<p>
   The REPLACE statement is used to replace source program text. 
<p>
   A REPLACE statement can occur anywhere in the source program where a 
   character-string can occur.  It must be preceded by a separator period 
   except when it is the first statement in a separately compiled program. 
   It must be terminated by a separator period. 
<p>
   The REPLACE statement provides a means of applying a change to an entire 
   COBOL source program, or part of a source program, without manually having 
   to find and modify all places that need to be changed.  It is an easy 
   method of doing simple string substitutions.  It is similar in action to 
   the REPLACING phrase of the COPY statement, except that it acts on the 
   entire source program, not just on the text in COPY libraries. 
<p>
   If the word REPLACE appears in a comment-entry or in the place where a 
   comment-entry can appear, it is considered part of the comment-entry.

<p>
 x The REPLACE statement can be used with DBCS literals and DBCS data names. 
<p>
   Pseudo-text can contain DBCS character-strings.  Pseudo-text containing 
   DBCS characters cannot be continued across lines. 
<p>
   The compiler processes REPLACE statements in a source program after the 
   processing of any COPY statements.  COPY must be processed first, to 
   assemble a complete source program.  Then REPLACE can be used to modify 
   that program, performing simple string substitution.  REPLACE statements 
   can themselves contain COPY statements.

   The character-strings and separators comprising pseudo-text can start in 
   either area A or area B.  If, however, there is a hyphen in the indicator 
   area of a line which follows the opening pseudo-text delimiter, area A of 
   the line must be blank; and the normal rules for continuation of lines 
   apply to the formation of text words.  (See <A HREF=#1.3.4.2>&quot;Continuation Lines&quot; in</A>

<A NAME=4.10.2><H3> 4.10.2   Comparison Operation</H3></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   The comparison operation to determine text replacement starts with the 
   leftmost source program text word following the REPLACE statement, and 
   with the first pseudo-text-1.  Pseudo-text-1 is compared to an equivalent 
   number of contiguous source program text words.  Pseudo-text-1 matches the 
   source program text if, and only if, the ordered sequence of text words 
   that forms pseudo-text-1 is equal, character for character, to the ordered 
   sequence of source program text words. 
<p>
   For purposes of matching, each occurrence of a separator comma, semicolon, 
   and space, and each sequence of one or more space separators is considered 
   to be a single space. 
<p>
 x However, when pseudo-text-1 consists solely of a separator comma or 
 x semicolon, it participates in the match as a text word (in this case, the 
 x space following the comma or semicolon separator can be omitted). 
<p>
   If no match occurs, the comparison is repeated with each successive 
   occurrence of pseudo-text-1, until either a match is found or there is no 
   next successive occurrence of pseudo-text-1. 
<p>
   When all occurrences of pseudo-text-1 have been compared and no match has 
   occurred, the next successive source program text word is then considered 
   as the leftmost source program text word, and the comparison cycle starts 
   again with the first occurrence of pseudo-text-1. 
<p>
   Whenever a match occurs between pseudo-text-1 and the source program text, 
   the corresponding pseudo-text-2 replaces the matched text in the source 
   program.  The source program text word immediately following the rightmost 
   text word that participated in the match is then considered as the 
   leftmost source program text word.  The comparison cycle starts again with 
   the first occurrence of pseudo-text-1. 
<p>
   The comparison operation continues until the rightmost text word in the 
   source program text which is within the scope of the REPLACE statement has 
   either participated in a match or been considered as a leftmost source 
   program text word and participated in a complete comparison cycle.

</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
   Comment lines or blank lines occurring in the source program text and in 
   pseudo-text-1 are ignored for purposes of matching.  The sequence of text 
   words in the source program text and in pseudo-text-1 is determined by the 
   rules for reference format (see <A HREF=#1.3>&quot;Reference Format&quot; in topic 1.3</A>).  Comment 
   lines or blank lines in pseudo-text-2 are placed into the resultant 
   program unchanged whenever pseudo-text-2 is placed into the source program 
   as a result of text replacement.  Comment lines or blank lines appearing 
   in source program text are retained unchanged with the following 
   exception: a comment line or blank line in source program text is not 
   retained if that comment line or blank line appears within the sequence of 
   text words that match pseudo-text-1. 
<p>
 x Lines containing *CONTROL (*CBL), EJECT, SKIP1/2/3, or TITLE statements 
 x can occur in source program text.  Such lines are treated as comment lines 
 x during REPLACE statement processing. 
<p>
   Debugging lines are permitted in pseudo-text.  Text words within a 
   debugging line participate in the matching rules as if the D did not 
   appear in the indicator area. 
<p>
   When a REPLACE statement is specified on a debugging line, the statement 
   is treated as if the D did not appear in the indicator area. 
<p>
   After all COPY and REPLACE statements have been processed, a debugging 
   line will be considered to have all the characteristics of a comment line, 
   if the WITH DEBUGGING MODE clause is not specified in the SOURCE-COMPUTER 
   paragraph. 
<p>
   Except for COPY and REPLACE statements, the syntactic correctness of the 
   source program text cannot be determined until after all COPY and REPLACE 
   statements have been completely processed. 
<p>
   Text words inserted into the source program as a result of processing a 
   REPLACE statement are placed in the source program according to the rules 
   for reference format.  When inserting text words of pseudo-text-2 into the 
   source program, additional spaces are introduced only between text words 
   where there already exists a space (including the assumed space between 
   source lines). 
<p>
   If additional lines are introduced into the source program as a result of 
   the processing of REPLACE statements, the indicator area of the introduced 
   lines contains the same character as the line on which the text being 
   replaced begins, unless that line contains a hyphen, in which case the 
   introduced line contains a space. 
<p>
   If any literal within pseudo-text-2 is of a length too great to be 
   accommodated on a single line without continuation to another line in the 
   resultant program and the literal is not being placed on a debugging line, 
   additional continuation lines are introduced that contain the remainder of 
   the literal.  If replacement requires the continued literal to be 
   continued on a debugging line, the program is in error. 
<p>
   <B>Note:</B>  Each word in pseudo-text-2 that is to be placed into the resultant 
   program begins in the same area of the resultant program as it appears in 
   pseudo-text-2.

   <kbd>file-name-1</kbd> 
       Valid for all files.  When this option is specified, the procedure is 
       executed only for the file(s) named.  No file-name can refer to a sort 
       or merge file.  For any given file, only one EXCEPTION/ERROR procedure 
       can be specified; thus, file-name specification must not cause 
       simultaneous requests for execution of more than one EXCEPTION/ERROR 
       procedure. 
<p>
       A USE AFTER EXCEPTION/ERROR declarative statement specifying the name 
       of a file takes precedence over a declarative statement specifying the 
       open mode of the file. 
<p>
   <kbd>INPUT</kbd> 
       Valid for all files. When this option is specified, the procedure is 
       executed for all files opened in INPUT mode or in the process of being 
       opened in INPUT mode that get an error. 
<p>
   <kbd>OUTPUT</kbd> 
       Valid for all files. When this option is specified, the procedure is 
       executed for all files opened in OUTPUT mode or in the process of 
       being opened in OUTPUT mode that get an error. 
<p>
   <kbd>I-O</kbd> 
       Valid for all direct-access files. When this option is specified, the 
       procedure is executed for all files opened in I-O mode or in the 
       process of being opened in I-O mode that get an error. 
<p>
   <kbd>EXTEND</kbd> 
       Valid for all files.  When this option is specified, the procedure is 
       executed for all files opened in EXTEND mode or in the process of 
       being opened in EXTEND mode that get an error. 
<p>
<p>
   The EXCEPTION/ERROR procedure is executed: 
<p>
   o   Either after completing the system-defined input/output error routine, 
       or 
<p>
   o   Upon recognition of an INVALID KEY or AT END condition when an INVALID 
       KEY or AT END phrase has not been specified in the input/output 
       statement, or 
<p>
   o   Upon recognition of an IBM-defined condition that causes status key 1 
       to be set to 9.  (See <A HREF=#2.8.9.1.1>&quot;Status Key&quot; in topic 2.8.9.1.1</A>.) 
<p>
   <B>Note:</B>  The EXTEND phrase is only valid under MVS and CMS, and for VSAM 
   files accessed sequentially under VSE.  For more information about the USE 
   statement under VSE, see <cite>VS</cite> <cite>COBOL</cite> <cite>II</cite> <cite>Application</cite> <cite>Programming</cite> <cite>Guide</cite> <cite>for</cite> 
   <cite>VSE.</cite> 
<p>
   After execution of the EXCEPTION/ERROR procedure, control is returned to 
   the invoking routine in the input/output control system.  If the 
   input/output status value does not indicate a critical input/output error, 
   the input/output control system returns control to the next executable 
   statement following the input/output statement whose execution caused the 
   exception. 
<p>
   The EXCEPTION/ERROR procedures are activated when an input/output error 
   occurs during execution of a READ, WRITE, REWRITE, START, OPEN, CLOSE, or 
   DELETE statement.  To determine what conditions are errors see <A HREF=#2.8.9.1>&quot;Common</A> 
   <A HREF=#2.8.9.1>Processing Facilities for Input-Output Statements&quot; in topic 2.8.9.1</A>. 
<p>
   Within a declarative procedure, there must be no reference to any 
   non-declarative procedures.  In the non-declarative portion of the 
   program, there must be no reference to procedure-names that appear in an 
   EXCEPTION/ERROR declarative procedure, except that PERFORM statements can 
   refer to an EXCEPTION/ERROR procedure or to procedures associated with it. 
<p>
   Within an EXCEPTION/ERROR declarative procedure, no statement should be 
   included that would cause execution of a USE procedure that had been 
   previously invoked and had not yet returned control to the invoking 
   routine. 
<p>
 x You can include a statement that executes a previously invoked USE 
 x procedure that is still in control.  However, to avoid an infinite loop, 
 x you must be sure that there is an eventual exit at the bottom. 
<p>
   EXCEPTION/ERROR procedures can be used to check the status key values 
   whenever an input/output error occurs.

<p>
   Special precedence rules are followed when programs are contained within 
   other programs.  In applying these rules, only the first qualifying 
   declarative that is selected for execution must satisfy the rules for 
   execution of that declarative.  The order of precedence for selecting a 
   declarative is: 
<p>
   1.  A file-specific declarative (that is, a declarative of the form USE 
       AFTER ERROR ON file-name-1) within the program that contains the 
       statement that caused the qualifying condition. 
<p>
   2.  A mode-specific declarative (that is, a declarative of the form USE 
       AFTER ERROR ON INPUT) within the program that contains the statement 
       that caused the qualifying condition. 
<p>
   3.  A file-specific declarative that specifies the GLOBAL phrase and is 
       within the program directly containing the program that was last 
       examined for a qualifying declarative. 
<p>
   4.  A mode-specific declarative that specifies the GLOBAL phrase and is 
       within the program directly containing the program that was last 
       examined for a qualifying condition. 
<p>
 | Steps 3 and 4 are repeated until the last examined program is the 
 | outermost program, or until a qualifying declarative has been found.

 x     The labels must be listed as data-names in the LABEL RECORDS clause in 
 x     the file description entry for the file, and must be described as 
 x     level-01 data items subordinate to the file entry. 
<p>
 x     If neither BEGINNING nor ENDING is specified, the designated 
 x     procedures are executed for both beginning and ending labels. 
<p>
 x     If FILE, REEL, or UNIT is not included, the designated procedures are 
 x     executed both for REEL or UNIT, whichever is appropriate, and for FILE 
 x     labels. 
<p>
 x <kbd>FILE</kbd> 
 x     The designated procedures are executed at beginning-of-file (on the 
 x     first volume) and/or at end-of-file (on the last volume) only. 
<p>
 x <kbd>REEL</kbd> 
 x     The designated procedures are executed at beginning-of-volume (on each 
 x     volume except the first) and/or at end-of-volume (on each volume 
 x     except the last). 
<p>
 x     The REEL option is not applicable to direct-access files. 
<p>
 x <kbd>UNIT</kbd> 
 x     The designated procedures are executed at beginning-of-volume (on each 
 x     volume except the first) and/or at end-of-volume (on each volume 
 x     except the last). 
<p>
 x     The UNIT phrase is not applicable to files in the random access mode, 
 x     because only FILE labels are processed in this mode. 
<p>
 x <kbd>file-name-1</kbd> 
 x     Can appear in different specific arrangements of the format.  However, 
 x     appearance of a file-name in a USE statement must not cause the 
 x     simultaneous request for execution of more than one USE declarative. 
<p>
 x     File-name-1 must not represent a sort file. 
<p>
 x     If the file-name-1 option is used, the file description entry for 
 x     file-name must not specify a LABEL RECORDS ARE OMITTED clause. 
<p>
 x When the INPUT, OUTPUT, or I-O options are specified, the user label 
 x procedures are executed as follows: 
<p>
 x o   When INPUT is specified, only for files opened as input. 
 x o   When OUTPUT is specified, only for files opened as output. 
 x o   When I-O is specified, only for files opened as I-O. 
 x o   When EXTEND is specified, only for files opened EXTEND. 
<p>
 x If the INPUT, OUTPUT, or I-O phrase is specified, and an input, output, or 
 x I-O file, respectively, is described with a LABEL RECORDS ARE OMITTED 
 x clause, the USE procedures do not apply.  The standard system procedures 
 x are performed: 
<p>
 x o   Before the user's beginning or ending input label check procedure is 
 x     executed 
<p>
 x o   Before the user's beginning or ending output label is created 
<p>
 x o   After the user's beginning or ending output label is created, but 
 x     before it is written on tape 
<p>
 x o   Before the user's beginning or ending input-output label check 
 x     procedure is executed. 
<p>
 x Within the procedures of a USE declarative in which the USE sentence 
 x specifies an option other than <B>file-name</B>, references to common label items 
 x need not be qualified by a file-name.  A common label item is an 
 x elementary data item that appears in every label record of the program, 
 x but does not appear in any data records of this program.  Such items must 
 x have identical descriptions and positions within each label record. 
<p>
 x Within a Declarative Section there must be no reference to any 
 x non-declarative procedure.  Conversely, in the non-declarative portion 
 x there must be no reference to procedure-names that appear in the 
 x Declarative Section, except that the PERFORM statement can refer to a USE 
 x procedure, or to procedures associated with it. 
<p>
 x The exit from a Declarative Section is inserted by the compiler following 
 x the last statement in the section.  All logical program paths within the 
 x section must lead to the exit point. 
<p>
 x There is one exception:  A special exit can be specified by the statement 
 x GO TO MORE-LABELS.  When an exit is made from a Declarative Section by 
 x means of this statement, the system will do one of the following: 
<p>
 x 1.  Write the current beginning or ending label and then reenter the USE 
 x     section at its beginning for further creating of labels.  After 
 x     creating the last label, the user must exit by executing the last 
 x     statement of the section. 
<p>
 x 2.  Read an additional beginning or ending label, and then reenter the USE 
 x     section at its beginning for further checking of labels.  When 
 x     processing user labels, the section will be reentered only if there is 
 x     another user label to check.  Hence, there need not be a program path 
 x     that flows through the last statement in the section. 
<p>
 x If a GO TO MORE-LABELS statement is not executed for a user label, the 
 x declarative section is not reentered to check or create any immediately 
 x succeeding user labels.

<p>
   A debugging line is a statement that is compiled only when the 
   compile-time switch is activated.  Debugging lines allow you, for example, 
   to check the value of a data-name at certain points in a procedure. 
<p>
   To specify a debugging line in your program, code a &quot;D&quot; in column 7 (the 
   indicator area).  You can include successive debugging lines, but each 
   must have a &quot;D&quot; in column 7 and you cannot break character strings across 
   two lines. 
<p>
   All your debugging lines must be written so that the program is 
   syntactically correct, whether the debugging lines are compiled or treated 
   as comments. 
<p>
   You can code debugging lines anywhere in your program after the 
   OBJECT-COMPUTER paragraph. 
<p>
   If a debugging line contains only spaces in Area A and in Area B, it is 
   treated as a blank line.

<A NAME=A.1.3.1.2><H3> APPENDIX1.3.1.2   Debugging Sections</H3></A>
</banner>
<pre width="80">
<p>
 | Debugging sections are obsolete language elements and will be deleted from 
 | the next revision of the COBOL 85 Standard. 
<p>
   Debugging sections are only permitted in the outermost program; they are 
   not valid in nested programs.  Debugging sections are never triggered by 
   procedures contained in nested programs. 
<p>
   Debugging sections are declarative procedures.  Declarative procedures are 
   described under <A HREF=#4.15>&quot;USE Statement&quot; in topic 4.15</A>.  A debugging section can be 
   invoked, for example, by a PERFORM statement that causes repeated 
   execution of a procedure.  Any associated procedure-name debugging 
   declarative section is executed once for each repetition. 
<p>
   A debugging section executes <I>only</I> if both the compile-time switch and the 
   object-time switch are activated. 
<p>
   The debug feature recognizes each separate occurrence of an imperative 
   statement <I>within</I> an imperative statement as the beginning of a separate 
   statement. 
<p>
   You cannot refer to a procedure defined within a debugging section in a 
   statement outside of the debugging section. 
<p>
   References to the DEBUG-ITEM special register can be made only from within 
   a debugging declarative procedure.

   The compile-time switch activates the debugging lines and sections.  To 
   place the compile-time switch in effect, specify WITH DEBUGGING MODE in 
   the SOURCE COMPUTER paragraph of the Configuration Section.

       When WITH DEBUGGING MODE is specified, all debugging sections and 
       debugging lines are compiled. 
<p>
       When WITH DEBUGGING MODE is omitted, all debugging sections and 
       debugging lines are treated as comments. 
<p>
   <B>Note:</B>  If you include a COPY statement as a debugging line, the &quot;D&quot; must 
   appear on the first line of the COPY statement.  VS COBOL II treats the 
   copied text as the debugging line or lines.  The COPY statement is 
   executed, regardless of whether WITH DEBUGGING MODE is specified or not.

<p>
   The object-time switch is set when the run-time option DEBUG or NODEBUG is 
   specified.  (DEBUG is the default supplied by IBM.)  See the &quot;Run-time 
   Options&quot; section in <cite>VS</cite> <cite>COBOL</cite> <cite>II</cite> <cite>Application</cite> <cite>Programming</cite> <cite>Guide</cite> <cite>for</cite> <cite>MVS</cite> <cite>and</cite> 
   <cite>CMS</cite> for the format. 
<p>
   The USE FOR DEBUGGING declarative procedures are activated when DEBUG is 
   in effect and inhibited when NODEBUG is in effect. 
<p>
   The debugging lines (D in column 7) are not affected by the DEBUG/NODEBUG 
   option; they are always active if they have been compiled. 
<p>
   When WITH DEBUGGING MODE is <B>not</B> specified in the SOURCE-COMPUTER 
   paragraph, the object-time switch has no effect on execution of the object 
   program. 
<p>
   You do not have to recompile the source program to activate or deactivate 
   the object-time switch.

<p>
   The compiler supports the American National Standard Code for Information 
   Interchange (ASCII).  Thus, the programmer can create and process tape 
   files recorded in accordance with the following standards: 
<p>
   o   American National Standard Code for Information Interchange, X3.4-1977 
<p>
   o   American National Standard Magnetic Tape Labels for Information 
       Interchange, X3.27-1978 
<p>
   o   American National Standard Recorded Magnetic Tape for Information 
       Interchange (800 CPI, NRZI), X3.22-1967. 
<p>
   ASCII-encoded tape files, when read into the system, are automatically 
   translated in the buffers into EBCDIC.  Internal manipulation of data is 
   performed exactly as if the ASCII files were EBCDIC-encoded files.  For an 
   output file, the system translates the EBCDIC characters into ASCII in the 
   buffers before writing the file on tape.  Therefore, there are special 
   considerations concerning ASCII-encoded files when they are processed in 
   COBOL. 
<p>
   This appendix also applies (with appropriate modifications) to the 
   International Reference Version of the ISO 7-bit code (ISCII) defined in 
   International Standard 646, 7-Bit Coded Character Set for Information 
   Processing Interchange.  The ISCII code set differs from ASCII only in the 
   graphic representation of two code points: 
<p>
   o   Ordinal number 37, which is a dollar sign ($) in ASCII, but a lozenge 
       (�) in ISCII 
<p>
   o   Ordinal number 127, which is a tilde (~) in ASCII, but an overline (or 
       optionally a tilde) in ISCII. 
<p>
   <B>Note:</B>  In the following discussion, the information given for STANDARD-1 
   also applies to STANDARD-2 except where otherwise specified. 
<p>
   The following paragraphs discuss the special considerations concerning 
   ASCII- (or ISCII-) encoded files.

<p>
   When at least one file in the program is an ASCII-encoded file, the 
   alphabet-name clause of the SPECIAL-NAMES paragraph must be specified; the 
   alphabet-name must be associated with STANDARD-1 or STANDARD-2 (for ASCII 
   or ISCII collating sequence or CODE SET, respectively). 
<p>
   When nonnumeric comparisons within the object program are to use the ASCII 
   collating sequence, the PROGRAM COLLATING SEQUENCE clause of the 
   OBJECT-COMPUTER paragraph must be specified; the alphabet-name used must 
   also be specified as an alphabet-name in the SPECIAL-NAMES paragraph, and 
   associated with STANDARD-1.  For example: 
<p>
     <samp>Object-computer.</samp>  <samp>IBM-370</samp> 
         <samp>Program</samp> <samp>collating</samp> <samp>sequence</samp> <samp>is</samp> <samp>ASCII-sequence.</samp> 
     <samp>Special-names.</samp>  <samp>Alphabet</samp> <samp>ASCII-sequence</samp> <samp>is</samp> <samp>standard-1.</samp> 
<p>
   When both clauses are specified, the ASCII collating sequence is used in 
   this program to determine the truth value of the following nonnumeric 
   comparisons: 
<p>
   o   Those explicitly specified in relation conditions 
   o   Those explicitly specified in condition-name conditions 
   o   Any nonnumeric sort or merge keys (unless the COLLATING SEQUENCE 
       phrase is specified in the MERGE or SORT statement). 
<p>
   When the PROGRAM COLLATING SEQUENCE clause is omitted, the EBCDIC 
   collating sequence is used for such comparisons. 
<p>
   The PROGRAM COLLATING SEQUENCE clause, in conjunction with the 
   alphabet-name clause, can be used to specify EBCDIC nonnumeric comparisons 
   for an ASCII-encoded tape file or ASCII nonnumeric comparisons for an 
   EBCDIC-encoded tape file. 
<p>
   The literal option of the alphabet-name clause can be used to process 
   internal data in a collating sequence other than NATIVE or STANDARD-1.

   In the Data Division, there are special considerations for the FD entry 
   and for data description entries. 
<p>
   For each logical file defined in the Environment Division, there must be a 
   corresponding FD entry and level-01 record description entry in the File 
   Section of the Data Division.

   The FD Entry for an ASCII-encoded file must contain a CODE-SET clause; the

   o   PICTURE clause specifications for all five categories of data are 
       valid. 
   o   For signed numeric items, the SIGN clause with the SEPARATE CHARACTER 
       phrase must be specified.

<p>
   An ASCII collated sort/merge operation can be specified in two ways: 
<p>
   o   Through the PROGRAM COLLATING SEQUENCE clause in the OBJECT-COMPUTER 
       paragraph. 
<p>
       In this case, the ASCII collating sequence is used for nonnumeric 
       comparisons explicitly specified in relation conditions and 
       condition-name conditions. 
<p>
   o   Through the COLLATING SEQUENCE phrase of the SORT or MERGE statement. 
<p>
       In this case, only this sort/merge operation uses the ASCII collating 
       sequence. 
<p>
   In either case, alphabet-name must be associated with STANDARD-1 (for 
   ASCII collating sequence) in the SPECIAL-NAMES paragraph. 
<p>
   For this sort/merge operation, the COLLATING SEQUENCE option takes 
   precedence over the PROGRAM COLLATING SEQUENCE clause. 
<p>
   If both the PROGRAM COLLATING SEQUENCE clause and the COLLATING SEQUENCE 
   phrase are omitted (or if the one in effect specifies an EBCDIC collating 
   sequence), the sort/merge is performed using the EBCDIC collating 
   sequence.
