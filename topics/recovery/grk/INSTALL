GRK by itself is free of installion burden.  That is, there is NO need
to run anything like autoconf, configure, gmake, gmake install or
whatever. (This is because all the tools etc. are plain Prolog
programs that are run by invoking the SWI-Prolog system, and the
remaining scripting is all accomplished by makefiles.)

These are the prerequisites for GRK:

- make (last tested under Leopard)
- SWI-Prolog (tested with version 5.6.62) 

Any recent version of these tools should work.  The makefiles assume
that SWI-Prolog is invoked via "swipl". SWI-Prolog can be downloaded from
this URL: http://www.swi-prolog.com Installing SWI-Prolog from a
binary or a source distribution is really trivial.

The simple and slow Prolog-based prototype parser, which demonstrates
the correct functioning of GRK and the recovery case for VS Cobol II
does not imply any further tooling requirement because this parser is
pure Prolog.

If you want to use the BTYACC-based Cobol parser that can be generated
with GRK (and with the help of GDK), then you need a number of additional
tools; see the subdirectory grammars/vscobolii/btyacc.
