GRK provides tool support for semi-automatic grammar recovery. With
the VS Cobol II case it also demonstrates the approach; see the README
file in grammars/vscobolii. GRK is based on library functionality for
Prological language processing and tools that automate certain aspects
of grammar engineering; see the subdirectories lib and tools.

To run the recovery case for VS Cobol II, type in:

> make

This will take you to the directory grammars/vscobolii, and two
deliverables are derived from IBM's standard for VS Cobol II: a
re-engineered Cobol reference; see the HTML files "*.html" in
grammars/vscobolii. Furthermore, a Prolog-based prototype parser
for Cobol is derived.

To test the Prolog-based parser, type in:

> make test

(GNU make is assumed here.)
Then a simple Cobol program will be parsed.
Watch out for "Parsed 42 lines.".

You can also generate a fast BTYACC-based parser.
See the subdirectory grammars/vscobolii for details.
