Thanks to William Cook for some tips.

See here for some background:

Interpreter.hs is a straightforward interpreter.

TrivialPartialEvaluator is a very simple online partial evaluator.

PartialEvaluator makes a proper effort:

- It specializes functions based on static variables.
- It memoizes specializations (even under recursion) to avoid non-termination and code cloning.
- It also avoids variable capture.

However, this evaluator would require post-processing.

In particular, synthesized functions with only a single application should be inlined.
