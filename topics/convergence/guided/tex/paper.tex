This report is meant to be used as auxiliary material for the \emph{guided grammar convergence} technique proposed in
\cite{Guided2013} as problem-specific improvement on \cite{Convergence2009}. It contains a megamodel renarrated as
proposed in \cite{Renarration2012}, as well as full results of the guided grammar convergence experiment on the
Factorial Language, with details about each grammar source packaged in a readable form. All formulae used within this
document, are generated automatically by the convergence infrastructure in order to avoid any mistakes. The generator
source code and the source of the introduction text can be found publicly available in the Software Language Processing
Suite repository~\cite{SLPS}.

Consider the model on \autoref{mega}. It is a \emph{megamodel} in the sense of \cite{BJV04,FNG04}, since it depicts a
\emph{linguistic architecture}: all nodes represent software languages and language transformations, and all edges
represent relationships between them. MegaL~\cite{MegaL} is used as a notation: blue boxes represent tangible
\emph{artefacts} (files, programs, modules, directories, collections of other concrete entities), yellow boxes denote
software \emph{languages} in the broad sense (from general purpose programming languages to data types and protocols),
light green boxes are used for \emph{functions} (in fact, model transformations) and dark green boxes are for
\emph{function applications}.

As we can see from \autoref{mega} if we start reading it from the bottom, there is a program
\href{https://github.com/grammarware/slps/blob/master/shared/rascal/src/converge/Guided.rsc}{Guided.rsc}, which was
written in Rascal metaprogramming language~\cite{Rascal}. It implements the guided grammar convergence process, which
input language is BGF (BNF-like Grammar Formalism, a straightforward internal representation format for grammars,
introduced in \cite{Convergence2009}). Its output language is $\Xi$BGF, a bidirectional grammar transformation language
introduced in \cite{Metasyntactically2012}. An application of the guided grammar convergence algorithm to two grammars:
one \emph{master grammar} defining the \emph{intended} software language (terminology of \cite{Guided2013}) and one
servant grammar (its label displayed in italics since it is actually a variable, not a concrete entity) --- yields a
transformation script that implements a grammar transformation than indeed transforms the servant grammar into the
master grammar. The process behind this inference is relatively complicated and involves triggered grammar design
mutations, normalisation to Abstract Normal Form, constructing weak prodsig-equivalence ($\Bumpeq$) classes and
resolving nominal and structural differences, as described on the theoretic level in \cite{Guided2013}.

The rest of the report presents instantiations of this megamodel for eleven concrete grammar sources:

\begin{description}
\item[adt:] an algebraic data type\footnote{\url{http://tutor.rascal-mpl.org/Courses/Rascal/Declarations/AlgebraicDataType/AlgebraicDataType.html}.} in Rascal~\cite{RascalTutor};
\item[antlr:] a parser description in the input language of ANTLR~\cite{ANTLR}.
Semantic actions (in Java) are intertwined with EBNF-like productions.
\item[dcg:] a logic program written in the style of definite clause grammars~\cite{DCG}.
% \item[ecore:] an Ecore model~\cite{MOF}, created manually in Eclipse modeling framework~\cite{EMF}
% 	and represented in XMI;
\item[emf:] an %alternative 
	Ecore model~\cite{MOF}, automatically generated by Eclipse~\cite{EMF} from the XML Schema of the
	\textbf{xsd} source;
\item[jaxb:] an object model obtained by a data binding framework.
Generated automatically by JAXB~\cite{JSR31} from the XML schema for FL.
\item[om:] a hand-crafted object model (Java classes) for the abstract syntax of FL.
\item[python:] a parser specification in a scripting language, using the PyParsing library~\cite{McGuire2007};
\item[rascal:] a concrete syntax specification in Rascal metaprogramming language \cite{RascalTutor,Rascal};
\item[sdf:] a concrete syntax definition in the notation of SDF~\cite{Klint93} with scannerless
generalized LR~\cite{EKV09,Visser97} as a parsing model.
\item[txl:] a concrete syntax definition in the notation of TXL (Turing eXtender Language) transformational framework \cite{DeanCMS02}, which, unlike SDF, uses a combination of pattern matching and term rewriting).
\item[xsd:] an XML schema~\cite{W3C-XSD} for the abstract syntax of FL.
