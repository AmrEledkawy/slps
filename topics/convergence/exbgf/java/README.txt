The version of the Java Language Specification grammar convergence case study
that is found in this directory, heavily employs EXBGF.

In order to view the old JLS case study with pure XBGF, go to ../../exbgf/java/

EXBGF is Extended XBGF, it is a vertical DSL defined on top of XBGF that allows
to specify grammar transformation steps in bigger and cleaner steps, thus
boosting the productivity of a grammar engineer.
