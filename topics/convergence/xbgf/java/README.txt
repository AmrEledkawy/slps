The version of the Java Language Specification grammar convergence case study
that is found in this directory, is based on pure XBGF.
This is the way it was done originally and published
at SCAM'09, CoRR abs/1107.4661 and SQJ 19(2)

To find the same files at the old Sourceforge repository of SLPS, check out revision 1170.
To find the same case study replicated in Extended XBGF, go to ../../exbgf/java/
