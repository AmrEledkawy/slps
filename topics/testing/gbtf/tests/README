Different kinds of test cases are grouped.

basics: BGF constructs are exercised.

coverage: coverage criteria are exercised.

tescol: actual grammars from a case study.

See the individual Makefiles for default configuration of test-data generation.

Here is a description of the options:

- root: only generate test data for the (declared or inferred) start symbol
- strip: produce very small BTFs
- sc: shortest completition (one item per nonterminal)
- nc (nonterminal coverage): exercise all reachable nonterminals
- rc (rule coverage): exercise all reachable rules (productions)
- bc (branch coverage): exercise all forks for "?", "*" and "+"
- cdbc (context-dependent bc): exercise all rules in all contexts
- uppy: do not "exhaust" top-level choices for ANTLR-style lexemes

No coverage critera are automatically selected.
