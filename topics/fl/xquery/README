In order to run it, one usually needs:

1) wget, http://www.statusq.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/wget.zip
2) PCRE, http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcre/
3) GODI, http://download.camlcity.org/download/godi-rocketboost-20080630.tar.gz
4) godi-galax, directly from godi_console, with all dependent packages

This all was needed to establish the infrastructure for Mac OS X Leopard, use and change accordingly.
