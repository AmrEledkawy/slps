We collect some encodings of semantics derived from Nielson and
Nielson, 2007 (and prior versions): Semantics with Applications
(including the slides available online). In particular, we capture the
denotational semantics of While both in direct and continuation style,
and we capture a static program analysis for sign detection.

The denotational development is delivered in a highly parametric
manner, that is, we capture direct style of denotational semantics in
a manner that specific semantics (such as the standard semantics and
the program analysis for sign detection) can be assembled by just
passing specific algebras to a more parametric function.
